<p>From <a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/batraciens/page_batraciens_6.htm">http://www.batraciens-reptiles.com/batraciens6.htm</a>:</p>
<p>I one am impassioned of the batrachians: here are others, of the family of
Hylidés: Phyllomedusinae. There, I cannot about it sneeze any more!!! With your
wishes!</p>
<p>The phylloméduses are tree frogs perfectly adapted to the arboricole life: they have disquesadhésifs at the end of the fingers and toes, their 2-3 fingers are opposable with the different one, which leurpermet to climb with ease very high in the trees and to be held using one only leg in the event of stunt-flying, with the manner of the caméléons.Certes, these characteristics are common to Hylidés; what differentiates this subfamily from the others, it is their capacity to be reproduced out of water, like Agalychnis, which guarantees a better survival of the offspring considering than the embryonic development, until the formation of the tadpole, occurs safe from one feuilleenroulée. To maturity, the tadpole which measures approximately 1 cm comes out of its egg and falls in the water point which is located below the nest. This mode of reproduction, which will be taken again in lower details, makes it possible to produce less ufsque other batrachians, like Bufonidés, which lay more than 30000 eggs in order to ensure to them descendance.Il exists in French Guiana four species of phylloméduse: P. bicolor, P. tomopterna, P. vaillantii and P. hypochondrialis. All are protected and prohibited from capture, destruction and detention.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The two-tone phylloméduse&nbsp;<br>
<b>scientific name:</b> Phyllomedusa bicolor.&nbsp;<br>
<b>name running:</b> there is not really, phylloméduse of Guyana with two colors, but is to laugh!&nbsp;<br>
<b>description:</b> It revêt a color green to tighten the day and green bronzes the night, small spots blanchâtres on the sides, ventral face and lower part of the sides tinted of a little orange yellow. Glandular fold thicker than the other subspecies from Guyana. going to the groin.<br>
<b> 
geographical distribution:</b> French Guiana and areas surrounding (I await precise details).&nbsp;<br>
<b>m.urs:</b> twilight and night, arboricole.&nbsp;<br>
<b>habitat:</b> wet tropical forest.&nbsp;<br>
<b>dimorphism:</b> male smaller than the female, and having brownish callosities on the fingers in period of reproduction. Relatively large tree frog, from 100 to 109 mm, with a maximum of 120,5mm.&nbsp;<br>
<b>song:</b> audible to a few tens of meters, left barking, Écoutez it!&nbsp;<br>
<b>food:</b> various insects flying and crawling.&nbsp;<br>
<b>terrarium:</b> identical to other Hylidés of big size; prohibited detention on all the French territory, departments and overseas territories.&nbsp;<br>
<b>reproduction:</b> reproduces all the year, according to precipitations. The female, attracted by the song of the most powerful male, moves towards him: this man.uvre can take 45 min. according to the distance which separate them (between 3 and 5m). After a court face to face, the male climbs on the female and the étreint with its forefeet to the level of the root of the arms and not under the armpits. Seized once, the female decides to select a broad sheet located above a water point distant from approximately 1 meter. Approximately 45 minutes later, the couple goes down to move back along the sheet and stops with the end of this one. The weight of the male and the movements of the posterior legs of the female contribute to the folding of the sheet; after this hard labour of approximately 15 minutes, one observes the emission of a transparent liquid inside the folding of the sheet. They can be not-formed ovules or only gangues, that the female encloses and sticks to the sheet with its posterior legs; 15 minutes later (of the subscribers to the 1/4h...!) the first ovules of color white creams are laid per successive packages and at once fertilized by the male. With each emission of ovules, the couple the cup, encloses and closes again the sheet on those. The couple marks a pause of approximately... know it to you... 15 minutes, then starts again the operation a few centimetres higher to finish their " nest " with new transparent ovules. Total duration of the coupling: approximately four hours; the male is detached from the female by pushing a small cry and leaves the places. The female, exhausted, leaves nest 45 minutes later: one could have named it " Phyllomedusa quardorata minuta ", I continue to be delirious! This observation was made between 23h45 and 5h30, July 2, 1993 per Christian and Victoire Marty. The sheets are selected not according to the species of the plant, but for their dimension. The nests all are exposed towards the east, located between 40cm and 3m50 of water, measures 8-15cm length. Ten day after the laying, from 600 to 1200 tadpoles approximately hatch. The males close to the sites of laying are increasingly more numerous than the females (of 10-25 males for 6 females, " pôvres "...) They sing in top of the trees and go down to reproduce only when the conditions weather are favorable, i.e. in the event of abundant rains. To still note that the tadpoles are held in water in a position with 45° compared to surface.&nbsp;<br>
<b>predators:</b> any type of arboricoles snakes (certain snakes oophages regale their eggs and can destroy entirety of the laying), and certain birds.&nbsp;<br>
<b>characteristics:</b> " engagements " between rival males are frequently observed: they are fights " with arm the bodies " finishing by the fall of the rivals on the ground or in water. This attitude is also found at Dendrobatidés. At the biochemical level, peptides vasodilators, opioïdes and antimicrobic were insulated recently in cutaneous secretions from P. bicolor. Certain tribes of Amérindiens use cutaneous secretions of this Amphibian for various practices: mixed with saliva and applied to points of fresh burns, this " potion " would cause a deep faintness, one period of apathy followed of an euphoric state accompanied by a feeling of force and a potentiation directions which would return them better hunters and gunners to the arc. A reduction in the feelings of cramp during the binding of the arc was also described.
