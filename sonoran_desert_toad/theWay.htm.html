<br>
		Approaching the Mystical Experience.<br>
			The fusion of the Self and the Universe<br>
	with the flowers of courage, be prepared to transcend<br>
								Everything one knows<br>
		With no resistance to experience, embrace everything<br>
		Recognize the empty, transparent freedom of consciousness<br>
		All substances are part of one's own consciousness,&nbsp;<br>
			this awareness is vacuous, unborn and unceasing.<br>
				The Mystical Experience is like a great musical 		phenomena before which the guest, seeking audience, must 		suspend
judgements, opinions and simply listen with all 		one's being, to fully appreciate.<br>
				An open mind, a willing heart, will receive 		full grace arising like the sun in the morning.<br>
		By degrees the mind will fill with light.<br>
		Follow the process you experience with a moving stillness 		of quite observation and you will penetrate to the 		greatest revelations.&nbsp;<br>
			Courage is the way, relaxation the key,<br>
				openness of heart and mind,<br>
					 the greatest power.<br>
	Offer flowers, light instrumental music, incense, yourself, 		let things happen<br>
		Playfully give yourself up to the process.<br>
			Fill you heart with trust<br>
			In this relaxed condition the mystical experience<br>
				has a chance to bloom and open within<br>
					on its own terms<br>
		Like a dance, one swings with it,&nbsp;<br>
			even if it vaults you beyond the stars<br>
		Be open to experience anything, with the knowledge<br>
					that all things pass<br>
			The Universe surrenders in celebration to he who<br>
				surrenders to the Universe<br>
			The Self must be open to the Light&nbsp;<br>
					for the Light to open the Self<br>
	These are the Jewels of Awakening that I give to you<br>
			in the same Spirit they were given to me.</p>
