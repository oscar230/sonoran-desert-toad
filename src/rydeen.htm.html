The following is total bullshit but it's a fun read...</p>

<h1>The Sex Life of the Psychedelic Toad</h1>
<h2>by Paul Rydeen</h2>
<font size="+0">CRASH COLLUSION Issue 3 Spring, 1993</font><br>

<p><font size="+0">Many of you are familiar with Bufo
Alvarius, the infamous Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran desert. Episodes of toad-licking
teenagers occasionally show up in newspapers, as another generation of
thrill-seekers learns of the powerful but short-lived effects of the toad's
venom. This toxin is secreted through glands located on the toad's neck and feet
when agitated; apparently the trait evolved as a deterrence to predators. Though
quick acting, the psychedelic may not act fast enough for a coyote or snake to
release its prey, but it seems clear enough that the ensuing &quot;trip&quot;
would be sufficient warning against future predation. Thus the individual gives
his life for the good of the species.</p>
<p>Readers of Wade Davis' <strong>The Serpent and the Rainbow</strong> will
remember that the venom of the Bufo Marinus, the Sea Toad, is used by Haitian <em>houngans</em> to make zombie
poison. The toad is placed in a jar or suitable container with a stinging sea
worm; the two battle each other, causing sufficient agitation the toad to
produce plenty of the drug for the dark operation. When mixed with just a little
venom from the poisonous blowfish - renown in Japanese sushi bars as <em>fugu</em>
- the intended victim becomes so completely catatonic that he is usually
pronounced dead and buried. One wonders how many unintentional overdoses of this
mixture induced actual death in the potential zombie. After a few days, the drug
wears off, the zombie is disinterred and rebaptized, and put to work. A steady
diet of datura ensures his continued complacency.
<p>Unlike its aquatic cousin, B. Alvarius seems to have only been used recreationally. Discovered during the height of the
hedonistic 1960's, the venom of the toad was collected and smoked by hippies
looking to expand their minds. The toad is easily caught by hand anywhere near
the irrigation canals in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona or the Mexican state of
Sonora. A little handling is all it takes for the toad to become sufficiently
agitated to produce the venom. After carefully scraping the raw poison from its
glands, the toad is gently released back into the wild. A few days is usually
needed for it to recover from a thorough &quot;milking&quot; such as this.
<p>Unknown to many, however, is the incredible role this toxin plays in the
mating cycle of the toad. Though each toad is entirely immune to its own venom,
slight enzymatic differences between the sexes means that they are susceptible
to their partner's. During the act of mating, the toads become just as agitated
as they would escaping a predator, and release copious quantities of the
hallucinogenic drug. The psychedelic is subsequently absorbed through the skin
by the other partner, where it has immediate effect. The toads reach climax in a
psychedelic frenzy, the libido of each inflamed with the power of the others
drug. Intercourse for the toads results in the ultimate mind-blowing orgasm,
excellent impetus for the successful propagation of the species. This is the
true reason for the folktales of the toad's aphrodisiac properties.</p>
