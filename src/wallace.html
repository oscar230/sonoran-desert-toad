        Bob,<br>
        <br>
        First, let me say that I am a long time observer of<br>
        this group, and I find your opinions to be some of the<br>
        most reliable, credible information that is to be<br>
        found here.<br>
        <br>
        Until recently, I've considered myself to be a fairly<br>
        well grounded, healthy individual, with a firm grip on<br>
        reality...however, I am no longer quite so convinced<br>
        about the firmness of the reality that surrounds us,<br>
        and that if nothing else, lack of perspective alone<br>
        makes it nearly impossible to fully grasp how the<br>
        world that we live and operate in operates at any<br>
        level beyond illusion.<br>
        <br>
        While I will try to provide a reasonably objective<br>
        trip report below, you must understand that my beliefs<br>
        have been drastically altered at a level deeper than I<br>
        was heretofore aware even existed. Also, bear in mind<br>
        I am *not* inexperienced when it comes to 'powerful'<br>
        psychedelic exploration.<br>
        <br>
        With that, here goes:<br>
        <br>
        First <SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None"> 5meo</SPAN> trip:<br>
        <br>
        40-50mg smoked using a classic dmt freebase pipe. One<br>
        hit, as deep as possible.<br>
        <br>
        Hold it in till I feel the wave washing over me.<br>
        <br>
        As I exhale, the smoke seems to act like a solvent,<br>
        dissolving all reality before my eyes.<br>
        <br>
        'Oh fuck, I've killed myself'<br>
        <br>
        Within 3-5 seconds, the 'canon' fires me through time<br>
        and space, and almost immediately, I am in a golden<br>
        city, surrounded by beings that are vaguely humanlike.<br>
        <br>
        **** This place was not alien to me, I had been<br>
        here many times before. At the same instant I arrived,<br>
        a thorough knowledge of this place, already in my<br>
        mind, and was now accessible. It was as if you took<br>
        some tribal native, dropped him in the middle of New<br>
        York City, and he was able to function as if he had<br>
        lived there all his life. I had a knowledge and<br>
        understanding of the place that seemed to me to have<br>
        taken 1000 lifetimes to acquire. Even the looks I got<br>
        from the entities seemed to indicate I wasn't a<br>
        stranger to the place. ****<br>
        <br>
        Then I though 'It's ok if I died, this is what is<br>
        real. This is HOME.'<br>
        <br>
        As if I was connected to the cannon with a bungee<br>
        cord, I felt a tugging, and soon, too soon, I was<br>
        involuntarily being pulled away. As the city became<br>
        distant, I felt as though I was being pulled backwards<br>
        through a 'gel' or 'membrane' of some sort. I felt all<br>
        the knowledge of the place and it's entities that had<br>
        been 'illuminated' in my mind was being masked again,<br>
        put away into inaccessible regions.<br>
        <br>
        Then I was pulled through the void for a short time.<br>
        <br>
        And abruptly, I was back in my chair, experiencing a<br>
        different type, but as powerful as I've ever<br>
        experienced, visuals. While I thought 'boy, these<br>
        visuals are very impressive, I should be impressed', I<br>
        found them to be unimportant in the wake of the<br>
        experience I had just had. In fact, I found the<br>
        remaining 20 minutes of effects to be annoying in the<br>
        sense that they were interfering with my ability to<br>
        share what I had just experienced.<br>
        <br>
        Within an hour I felt I had returned to baseline.<br>
        <br>
        But it was not to be.<br>
        <br>
        Over the next 5 days, I found more and more details of<br>
        where I had been and what I had seen coming back to<br>
        me, trickling in at inopportune moments sometimes, and<br>
        being forcibly 'dug' out at others.<br>
        <br>
        I was forced to reconsider each and every aspect of my<br>
        life, and put *everything* into it's new place.<br>
        <br>
        I was relieved to find out I still loved those I loved<br>
        previously, but almost everything outside of that<br>
        became much less important, if not entirely dismissed<br>
        as illusionary.<br>
        <br>
        The parts of my life I still believed in became much<br>
        more concrete, and the rest remained dissolved by the<br>
        'solvent' I blew out of my mouth after the hit.<br>
        <br>
        Within 2 days I realized I had developed what seemed<br>
        to me to be a new sense. I think it will be impossible<br>
        to explain that here (I engaged in 9 hours of very,<br>
        very heavy conversation, with a friend, trying to<br>
        explain it). This sense seems to give me a feeling of<br>
        life forces all around, but not life in the classical<br>
        sense, rather, awareness of a unified, all encompassing<br>
        consciousness. It emanates from dark forests, the night<br>
        sky, the sea, and even feelings, as I drive past<br>
        cemeteries, that those buried beneath, still live in<br>
        some way, not detectable, not in some 'living dead'<br>
        sense, but that there is some pulsing, invisible<br>
        afterglow within the seemingly vacant corpses. I<br>
        realize this might sound gruesome, but It provides me<br>
        with a sense of solace and peace beyond belief.<br>
        <br>
        I found the strength to quit my job, I realized how<br>
        absurd it was to pursue something so empty and<br>
        meaningless that didn't bring me fulfillment.<br>
        <br>
        I joined political movements that I used to only<br>
        'silently' agree with.<br>
        <br>
        After a week or so, I retained my new found consciousness, but I stopped<br>
        distracting me, and I settled into it, becoming at ease with the situation.<br>
        <br>
        For purposes of clarification (and upon refection after doing it several more<br>
        times since), I would define the initial experience as following this order:<br>
        <br>
        5Meo-->The Canon->The City/Entities-->'Bungee cord' beginning to tug-->The<br>
        gel/membrane-->The void-->Back into my body->Ancillary effects<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Second 5meo trip:<br>
        <br>
        25mg(?) attempted to smoke/lighter died, unknown how much actually consumed.<br>
        <br>
        I only managed to get to the 'void'. Again, for purposes of clarification,<br>
        the order this time was:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        5Meo-->The Canon-->The void-->Bungee cord beginning to tug--> Back into my<br>
        body->Ancillary effects<br>
        <br>
        ***I learned nothing from this experience, and from reading other reports,<br>
        it seems that the 'void' is as far as the vast majority of 5meo users<br>
        get.***<br>
        <br>
        An incredibly powerful experience to be sure, but empty, like a<br>
        roller coaster ride.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Third 5meo trip:<br>
        <br>
        25mg(?) attempted to smoke, this time the glass cracked from the heat of the<br>
        butane torch. Unknown how much actually consumed.<br>
        <br>
        Not even the void this time, straight to the 'tryp' effects, and back to<br>
        baseline in 30 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        At this point, I was beginning to wonder if what I experienced the first<br>
        time actually happened.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Forth <SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None"> 5meo</SPAN> trip:<br>
        <br>
        35mg smoked - <SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">Success</SPAN>!<br>
        Back to the golden 'city'!<br>
        <br>
        The difference this time, was that I had a little more time, and seemed to<br>
        be able to take one step forward, and open my 'mouth' to speak before the<br>
        cord pulled me back.<br>
        <br>
        I think with focus, I may be able to stay longer, though I wonder if you<br>
        fight the cord long enough, you just don't come back at all.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyway, I could fill volumes with these experiences, and I hesitated to even<br>
        write this down for some time. I was urged by a friend to share this<br>
        information. For each detail I write down, I feel as though I'm leaving 100<br>
        more out.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope your journeys get you there.<br>

        That's a common message in many Eastern religious systems...&nbsp;<br>
        A lot of people read this and think it's a pretty metaphor... ;)<br>

        This might be explained (from a brain perspective) as a&nbsp;<br>
        kind of "flashback", though that doesn't mean it's a&nbsp;<br>

        <br>
        I know what you mean, and have heard this expressed in many&nbsp;<br>
        ways: a knowledge that we are all part of some unified wholeness&nbsp;<br>
        or being, that our experience here as separate beings going through&nbsp;<br>
        our separate lives is an illusion. Sometimes this gets expressed&nbsp;<br>
        as the idea that one cosmic being divided its consciousness into&nbsp;<br>
        many separate beings (for whatever reason).&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        >I found the strength to quit my job, I realized how absurd it was to&nbsp;<br>
        >pursue something so empty and meaningless that didn't bring me&nbsp;<br>
        >fulfillment.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Well, that's one perspective...<br>
        <br>
        Note that if our lives and world here really are illusions, Someone&nbsp;<br>
        has gone to a lot of trouble to create the illusion, probably for&nbsp;<br>
        some good reason.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Look at the movie analogy. All the actors and audience know it&nbsp;<br>
        the movie story is an illusion. But (generally) an actor does not&nbsp;<br>
        suddenly say, "Hey, everyone, this isn't real, we're just actors&nbsp;<br>
        in some movie, its empty and meaningless for me to continue&nbsp;<br>
        to play this artificial role." The actual role in the movie may be&nbsp;<br>
        uninteresting and unfulfilling by itself, but this part is integral to&nbsp;<br>
        the whole movie, and the movie has meaning (on our level) as&nbsp;<br>
        a statement of the human condition or whatever.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        That's not to assume your "role" should be to continue your old&nbsp;<br>
        job, or quit, or whatever. Knowing you're really an actor still does&nbsp;<br>
        not present you with the script ;) though one can develop an intuition&nbsp;<br>
        as to what the "unity" (or God if you prefer) would like you to do next.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        >After a week or so, I retained my new found consciousness, but I stopped<br>
        >distracting me, and I settled into it, becoming at ease with the situation.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I've heard another report of a strong 5 experience in which the person&nbsp;<br>
        felt different for about a week; they described it as "like all the bricks&nbsp;<br>
        which make up my body were still there, but the mortar was gone, and&nbsp;<br>
        the bricks stayed in position by some magic; I could still function&nbsp;<br>
        without problems, but felt "looser" and more free."&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Yes, one can have the knowledge of and a deep connection to the&nbsp;<br>
        underlying Unity of reality beyond the everyday illusion, and still carry&nbsp;<br>
        on one's part in the illusion. "Before <SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">enlightenment</SPAN>, you chop
        wood&nbsp;<br>
        and carry water; after <SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">enlightenment</SPAN>, you chop wood and carry
        water."&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        >Second 5meo trip:<br>
        >25mg(?) attempted to smoke/lighter died, unknown how much actually consumed.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        One reason to carefully measure your doses is so you can try to recreate&nbsp;<br>
        particularly interesting experiences...&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        >I only managed to get to the 'void'...<br>
        >***I learned nothing from this experience, and from reading other reports,<br>
        >it seems that the 'void' is as far as the vast majority of 5meo users get.***<br>
        <br>
        I think a lot of people only get to this "void", or at least don't remember<br>
        <br>
        anything beyond this. There may be a similarity with "plain" DMT ;)&nbsp;<br>
        in that people report one needs to smoke enough to get past a certain&nbsp;<br>
        "threshold".&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        At the same time, I must repeat the caution that this is a very intense&nbsp;<br>
        drug, and people do sometimes get traumatized by the experience,&nbsp;<br>
        and have significant PTSD type symptoms for some time.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        >...I think with focus, I may be able to stay longer, though I wonder if you<br>
        >fight the cord long enough, you just don't come back at all.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I believe, if your basic intention is to stay alive (you are not depressed&nbsp;<br>
        or otherwise suicidal), it's safe to try to stay there, and "let go" into&nbsp;<br>
        the experience, and assume the drug will wear off and you'll come back.&nbsp;<br>

        <br>
        Yes, written language is always incomplete... Visual images can usually&nbsp;<br>
        be described, but some of the feelings, like of connection or unity, are&nbsp;<br>
        hard to really express...&nbsp;<br>
