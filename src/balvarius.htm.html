<p align="left">In the early to mid 1800's, the children of Europe began their
Manifest Destiny westward from the eastern United States. During this time, the Smithsonian Institution
dispatched exploring expeditions to survey the land and its creature
inhabitants. One of those early explorers was Major G. H. Thomas. In 1855, he
became the first white man to discover and collect a specimen of our beloved
toad. (USNM No. 2572) However, it wasn't until 1859 that a Frenchman by the name of <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/vert/fishes/baird/girard.html" target="_blank"> Charles F.
Girard</a>, while working on the US and Mexican Boundary Survey, became the first white man to
catalog and give this toad its official scientific name; Bufo alvarius.&nbsp;Because
Major Thomas found his toad in Old Fort Yuma, California, across the Colorado
River from Yuma, Arizona, (near the junction with the Gila River,) the toad was
commonly referred to later as the Colorado River toad. Today, we commonly refer
to B. alvarius as the Sonoran Desert toad to reflect the fact that it occurs
almost exclusively in the region of the Sonoran Desert.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/vert/fishes/baird/girard.html" target="_blank"><img src="resources/images/girard.jpg" width="185" height="252" hspace="15" vspace="10" border="1" alt="Charles F. Girard"></a></p>
<p>
The Latin for "alvus" is the womb or belly. And the Latin for "arius" is belonging
to. Bufo alvarius belongs to the womb. Older than the dinosaurs, she is a
Divinity, the great primeval Earth Mother, the source and the end of all life.
Of the more than <a href="amphibiaweb.htm.html" target="_blank"> 260 toads</a> 
inhabiting planet Earth, there is none other like her. For in her venom glands
is contained a <a href="5meo.htm.html" target="_blank"> magic substance</a> that when dried and smoked induces a psychedelic
near-death experience of great intensity, but of short duration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Sonoran Desert toad</b> occurs in lowland areas of southern Arizona
and adjacent corners of southeastern California, southwestern New Mexico and
northeastern Baja, California, through most of Sonora, and into Sinaloa, Mexico.
See the distribution map <a href="general.htm.html#DISTRIBUTION" target="_blank">here</a>.
These toads are found mainly in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone, but also occur in
the Upper Sonoran, ranging from about sea level to 5300 feet. They occur
primarily in desert, but also in grassland and lower oak-woodland, commonly
taking refuge in rodent burrows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is true of most toads, B. alvarius is nocturnal. Many of these toads spend
a large part of their lives entombed in the Earth. The arrival of the monsoon rains in summer
softens the ground and brings them out of aestivation (toad hibernation.) <a href="jabstracts.htm.html#study" target="_blank">
One study</a> discovered that the majority of the B. alvarius toad population only comes out of
aestivation when there are repeated "significant rainfall events"
which are defined as greater than one inch of rainfall within a twenty-four hour period.
However, some B. alvarius are not dependant on the whims of Mother Nature to
provide the monsoon rains for their appearance. They have adapted well to life
around people, (our night time lights attract a hardy meal,) and they obviously
do not bury themselves underground, but possibly find refuge under man-made
structures that allow for easier access in and out of their abodes.
Consequently, one may find these toads feeding at night any time between May and
September. Still, the largest number of B. alvarius will always be found after
much heavy rainfall where they will breed in temporary pools, cattle ponds, and
slow moving streams. Eggs (view pictures <a href="eggs.htm.html" target="_blank">here</a>)
are deposited in long (400 inches) ropelike strings,
7,500 to 8,000 at a time. In Arizona, the monsoon rains occur mostly around July,
give or take a month. Learn more about the unique weather pattern of the
monsoon, and how to track it, <a href="general.htm.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Sonoran Desert toad is the largest of the western toads and is extremely
fast when it decides to make a getaway - it doesn't hop, it gallops! Adults may
attain a snout-vent length of up to seven inches. The skin is generally smooth,
especially for a toad, but with small scattered warts. The color varies from
dark brown, gray, olive-green, bright-green, and yellow-orange on the dorsal
side, and mostly cream-colored on its ventral side. There is at least one large round,
whitish tubercle at each corner of the mouth. The parotoids, above and behind the
tympanums (eardrums,)
are long and somewhat kidney-shaped, and venom glands also occur on the hind
legs and usually on the forearms as well. The cranial crests are prominent and
crescent-shaped. The irises are rust-colored. See the <a href="balvarius.htm.html#color">images</a>
from around the Internet or see the <a href="photoGallery.htm.html" target="_blank">Photo Gallery</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="1" src="resources/images/amplexus.jpg" alt="B. alvarius amplexing" width="422" height="437"></p>

<p align="left">Amplexus is the mating embrace of frogs and toads. The male
clasps the female from behind. The sexes can be distinguished by the dark nuptial pads on the thumbs and
inner fingers of the male; the thumb is larger than that of the female. Also, in
general, males will cluck incessantly when picked up&nbsp;- this is <a href="release.htm.html" target="_blank">the male release call</a>.
Females are generally silent but tend to puff and inflate their bodies with air
when picked up. (The toad's skin is permeable and sensitive to toxins, so be
careful that your hands are clean if you are going to handle toads.)</p>

<p>Sonoran Desert toads have voracious appetites and will eat any living thing they can
get into their mouths.&nbsp;All manner of&nbsp; insect, beetles, grasshoppers,
spiders, small lizards, scorpions, centipedes, mice, and smaller toads are just
some examples of what B. alvarius will eat.</p>

<p>The call of B. alvarius has been described as weak for its size. You can hear
this for yourself:</p>
