  <b>How to Properly Smoke Toad Venom</b>


  <p>


    Head shops sell glass pipes and small torches that work perfect for smoking toad
    venom. You want the free-base style of pipe, like a &quot;crack&quot;
    pipe. Regular pot or tobacco pipes or bongs will partially waste this
    valuable substance.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, when you have the correct pipe, you will also need a very strong blue
    flame. Use a small torch or gas burner. A candle or cigarette lighter WILL NOT burn hot enough to be effective. You
    need instant combustion.</p>
  <p>Realize that the torch flame never comes
    into direct contact with the toad venom. Direct contact with fire
    consumes a portion of the venom and turns it into ash. What a terrible
    waste! With the correct method, there is no waste.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Put the &quot;<a href="5meo.htm.html#dose">proper dose</a>&quot; of venom in the pipe AND WITHOUT YET INHALING,
    apply a
    BLUE flame to the outside bottom of the pipe where the dose is located. The venom will
    soon melt and begin to vaporize when the
    torch flame is applied long enough. One will hear a VERY DISTINCT
    POPPING AND CRACKLING as this occurs. It is AT THIS POINT IN TIME that the active
    participant should begin to inhale the sacred essence of the toad
    venom. WHILE KEEPING THE FLAME DIRECTLY ON THE PIPE, one should inhale
    LONG and SLOW. Remember, strong
    heat is what sustains this chemical reaction, and the process of drawing
    air through the pipe quickens it. Obviously, the vapor
    should be held in the lungs for as long as is necessary to induce the
    experience. If vapor can be seen during the exhale, the participant has
    definitely ingested a sufficient dose and, without a doubt,&nbsp; is
    well on their way into the experience by this time.


  </p>


  <p>Another smoking method involves using a modified light bulb. You
    break the metal part off of the bulb using a tiny pin
    hammer, a rock hammer, or something similar without shattering
    the rest of the bulb. Then wash out the inside of the bulb. When you're ready, put the venom in
    the bulb and heat the bottom with a blue flame, and inhale the smoke as it comes
    out of the bottleneck of the bulb. Or, you can suck it out through
    a straw. The idea is that you want to heat the venom with the flame, not
    burn it like with pot. And honestly, the only way to smoke venom is to put a
    big heaping dose in the pipe and just keep toking on this one big hit until
    the effects come on. And you won't have any question about when you've reached
    that
    point - because if you do, then you didn't get enough toad smoke in your lungs.
    Try it again. <br>

    Here are the melting points of some free-bases:

    Ott's <a HREF="ott.htm.html#melt" target="_blank">experiments</a> with isolated free-base bufotenine placed the
    melting point at about 124-126&#176 C. However he points out that others
    have reported isoforms melting from [123-]124-126[-129]&#176 C and 146-147[-150]&#176 C from isolated material and
    146-147&#176 C and 138-140&#176 C from synthetic material. This suggests that there are three isoforms, and the
    melting point may vary depending on what one has on hand. Citing Shulgin &amp; Shulgin 1997, Ott also mentions that
    three distinct DMT isoforms with melting points ranging from 44-74&#176 C have been reported (Ott 2001), and at
    least two of these forms have been produced by the drug underground (Sand 2000). As well as different isoforms
    creating different melting points, the method of
    crystallization, purity, and several other factors can affect the melting point. 5-MeO-DMT has been listed as having
    a melting point of 67.5-68.5&#176 C (Ott 1996). It is also worth noting that different salts will have different
    melting points.<br>
    <br>
    All of which in no way negates the point that if one is vaporizing bufotenine, one is going to have to use more heat
    than is needed for DMT or 5-MeO-DMT. It is worth pointing out though, that the melting point is not the final
    temperature that one wants to reach when vaporizing the free-base, but rather it is the boiling point that is key;
    this is the only temperature that changes a liquid into a gas, and it is sometimes twice as high as the
    melting point - David Aardvark<br>

  <p align="left">&gt; One other thing about the toad experience: Is the feeling that one is dying due to
    a real physiological action - increased heart rate, rapid rise in body temperature
    - or is that part of the Shamanic aspects of the
    experience?</p>


  <p align="left">
    Ah! That is part of the mystery! My guess is that the tryptamines open you
    up to the spirit = energetic worlds. This is a space that every Soul knows
    quite well but as humans we have mostly forgotten so that we
    can play the Earth game without too much interference or distraction. When
    your the brain is so overloaded with the 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenine, and everything else in the
    venom, the connection to the energetic realm is so immediate and so intense,
    that the only conclusion your physical body can render is that you've died
    and you're making your way out of this dimension. Fortunately, this is not
    the case! I have never heard of anyone dying from smoking toad venom - but
    it will certainly reveal areas of your life that you may want to put to
    rest!</p>


  <p align="left">From <a href="http://de1.erowid.org/culture/characters/mckenna_terence/mckenna_terence.html"
      target="_blank"> Terence McKenna</a> in The Archaic Revival:<br>
    One of the interesting characteristics of DMT is that it sometimes inspires fear - this marks the experience as
    existentially authentic. One of the interesting approaches to evaluating such a compound is to see how eager people
    are to do it a second time. A touch of terror gives the stamp of validity to the experience because it means, "This
    is real." We are in the balance. We read the literature, we know the maximum doses, the LD-50, and so on. But
    nevertheless, so great is one's faith in the mind that when one is out in it one comes to feel that the rules of
    pharmacology do not really apply and that control of existence on that plane is really a matter of focus of will and
    good luck.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I'm not saying that there's something intrinsically good about terror. I'm saying that, granted the situation, if
    one is not terrified then one must be somewhat out of contact with the full dynamics of what is happening. To not be
    terrified means either that one is a fool or that one has taken a compound that paralyzes the ability to be
    terrified. I have nothing against hedonism, and I certainly bring something out of it. But the experience must move
    one's heart, and it will not move the heart unless it deals with the issues of life and death. If it deals with life
    and death it will move one to fear, it will move one to tears, it will move one to laughter. These places are
    profoundly strange and alien.

    &quot;Yes, well I see that the Guardian dutifully reported all one would need to know to get seriously involved in
    toad abuse. In America we hear about toad licking and it's always advanced as a folkway of the primitive Australians
    and we in America have gone on one better. First of all, we don't hurt our toads, we drive out into the desert in
    our four-wheel-drive vehicles and we gently milk our toads onto what we call the windshield -- a windscreen -- and
    then it dries in the sun and we get out our little frost scrapers and scrape this better-left-undescribed material
    off the windshield and then this is smokable. This is 5-methoxy-DMT from Bufo Alvarius, and it passes all the tests.
    Well, not the test as would occur in a plant, no, it occurs in an animal, that's better. It's interesting, it's one
    of the few animal-based hallucinogens -- we call it toad foam, as opposed to more inelegant appellations that have
    been used. It's 5-mythoxy-DMT, so it's a variety of dimethyltryptamine, but compared to DMT it's sort of like AM
    radio versus 70 millimetre cinemascope. There's what I heard a researcher describe last week as an 'effulgent
    emotion' -- yes, there certainly is. There's no word for this emotion, but it's very large, but there is very little
    visual activity, kind of after-image-like stuff, but you know on DMT the hallucinations have an existential veracity
    that's absolutely jaw-dropping.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    (We sat with Terrance in Arizona and toad venom came up in the discussion. He certainly wasn't impressed with it.
    When he smoked it, he was waiting for something really big to occur but that never
    happened. We thought that perhaps he didn't take a large enough hit.
    So apparently, he never really had THE toad experience. We miss you Terrance!)
