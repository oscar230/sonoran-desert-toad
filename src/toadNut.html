        As a child I that toads are not only somewhat special, but also a good Omen learned. My nut/mother said always
        that we might not do children to the toads anything, this misfortune would bring. Later I learned that the
        so-called witches mixed loving gladly toads into their charm watering place, and that some �wunderliche� People
        with the help of the toads warts away witches could. I experienced still later that my Germanic-Baltic ancestors
        beside sun, moon, sky, earth and trees admired also toads as divinities.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Toads accompanied me my whole life. In the study I trusted with the praekolumbianischen toad representations and
        examined myself the meaning the toad in the cultures of the Olmeken, Maya and Lakandonen. I stolperte when my
        study the charm stones over the toad stones, which were apparent symbols of illuminating. Some years ago I
        finally met the toad nut/mother in erfahrbare way.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        In the environment of Tuscon (Arizona, the USA) the Colorado River Toad (Bufo alvarius) lives. This toad spends
        nine months underground, coated from mud, and by it protected against the track-transmitted desert sun. With the
        first rainfalls the toads come from their slip angles crept and begin with the dear luring for the other sex.
        They remain visible for three months. Like all toads, then also the Bufo forms alvarius in two glands, which are
        because of the neck, a slimy secretion out&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        In the last decades the secretions were examined by different toads and frogs (Dendrobates) chemically. One has
        beside toxic constituents (Bufonin, Bufotalin, Bufogin, Bufodienolide etc..) in the secretion of the enormous
        sea toad (Bufo marinus), a psychoaktives molecule discovers the Bufotenin (5-Hydro-xydimethyltryptamin). In the
        secretion of the Colorado River Toad however the toxic active substances are missing. In the dry weight for it
        15% 5-Methoxy-N is contained, n-dimethyltryptamin (5-Meo-DMT). The 5-Meo-DMT occurs not only in the toad
        secretion, but also in countless plants, which from South American Indians processed to psychedelischen
        Schnupfpulvern or to which Ayahuasca are added. This neurotransmitter, which is formed also in our nervous
        system, seems the material for the ultimative schamanische Ekstase, for illuminating and for coming up into the
        �klare light of the Todes� to be.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The Indians, who lived in the southwest of North America, manufactured fetische of these toads. Otherwise their
        cultural meaning and its psychedelischer use were only discovered in the last years, discovered probably
        nevertheless again. The toad leaves itself to �melken�. In addition a living animal is accessed and held, but is
        not crushed. The two glands are then easily massed, until a thick jet of the precious secretion
        herausejakuliert. One catches this splash with a windowpane. To it the secretion can dry and crystallize. The
        yellowish, crystalline mass can now be scraped off and also a few herbs, for example Damiana (Turnera diffusa),
        be smoked mixed. One dismisses the toad without prejudice to. It can make up for fast the secretion
        loss.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I had some years ago to smoke the opportunity something from this wondrous secretion to. It was in California. I
        sat naked in the Hottub, a type wooden bath trough. The water was hot, the night fresh, asterisk clear. A friend
        sets a small Pfeifchen to my lips and guessed to so long keep twice deeply to inhalieren and the smoke as
        possible in the lung. By the smell and taste of the smoke I detected the presence of the DMTs. whom once this
        smell into the nose rose, which will always remember. With me the smell produced a respectful expectation, the
        notion of mystischer Transzendenz seized me. The initial excitement sloshed into a koestliche relaxation over. I
        had the feeling that the molecules of my body stretched themselves and a freshness blew through wind. I took a
        second course and felt immediately, how I was carried off by the DMT. Me the heading fell into the
        neck.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I sat in the water, and only my face was at air. I looked into the sky. The asterisks radiated ever more
        brightly. They increased. Everything was the full Milky Ways. The lights danced and danced. The asterisk flood
        dissolved to amorphous, light-impregnated measure. From this the dark outlines of a nature, an enormous nature
        flowed together. The asterisk carpet assumed the shape of a gigantic toad. I knew immediately that it was the
        toad nut/mother, one the oldest Goettinnen of the mankind, which flowed together there in the sky. The toad
        glittered in all colours. It took my entire visual field and climbed down from the sky. Down to me in the bath
        trough. It touched me, embraced and kissed themselves. An intimate contact, a koestlicher kiss, a moving
        embrace. We merged together. I felt like an unbelievably positive strength, a correct welfare strength into my
        body flowed. I knew, the toad nut/mother me assumed.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I opened the eyes and sat in the bath trough. The water was still hot, the night still fresh, but I was
        infinitely enriched. When I rose from the water, I felt as newborn, erstarkt, tonically and erfrischt myself. I
        felt each fiber my muscles. Everything felt tapered, cleaned and healed on. I was full life desire and
        aphrodisischer impulses. I was lucky, finally the response to the question �Warum am toads heilig?� to have
        found.&nbsp;<br>
