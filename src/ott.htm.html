Human Intranasal, Sublingual, Intrarectal, Pulmonary and Oral Pharmacology of
Bufotenine<br>
by <a href="http://de1.erowid.org/culture/characters/ott_jonathan/ott_jonathan.html" target="_blank"> Jonathan Ott</a></font></p>
<p>In a previous paper on pharmahuasca psychonautics, modeling ayahuasca or
Banisteriopsis caapi (Spr. ex Griseb.) Mort. (Malpighiaceae) potions via
self-experiments with pure harmine and DMT or N,N-dimethyltryptamine (Ott 1999;
1994), I noted that Holmstedt and Lindgren had originally proposed in the
context of shamanic snuffs what I called the &quot;ayahuasca effect&quot;
activation of the orally inactive (and, presumably, also intranasally-inactive)
DMT by concomitant administration of monoamine-oxidase inhibiting (MAOI) beta-carbolines,
mainly harmine - later extended to encompass also orally-ingested ayahuasca
potions in its purview. These chemists found all but one of six South American
snuffs to contain tryptamines, whereas a Piaroa parica snuff also contained
harmine; a Surdra epéna snuff only beta-carbolines (Holmstedt &amp; Lindgren
1967; Bernauer 1964); likewise a Tucano paricá snuff (Biocca et al. 1964).</p>
<p>Since snuff tryptamines appeared (erroneously) to be nonpsychoactive
intranasally (Turner &amp; Merlis 1959), Holmstedt and Lindgren (1967: 365)
conjectured that beta-carbolines in the snuffs could potentiate the action of
the simple indoles.&quot; (Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 273 Volume 33 (3), July
- September 2001) In my pharmahuasca study, this ingenious theory was
effectively confirmed in human beings, with respect to orally ingested ayahuasca
potions, and I noted that the snuffs which originally inspired it had been all
but forgotten, but were also being studied psychonautically. In this second of
four related papers, I report psychonautic bioassays of pharmañopo, modeling
shamanic snuffs containing principally the recondite tryptamine bufotenine; the
third paper will model snuffs based on its Omethyl congener, 5-MeO-DMT (Ott In
press); the last Nicotiana snuffs containing principally nicotine as
psychoactive agent.</p>
<p>Despite homology of their active principles, shamanic snuffs containing
bufotenine and 5-MeO-DMT constitute distinct topics. The latter are far more
restricted geographically and culturally than the former. While there is almost
no published human pharmacology on 5-MeO-DMT (albeit it is well established as a
psychoptic, or visionary agent), the converse obtains for bufotenine, commonly
said to lack visionary psychoactivity, although there are five published reports
on its human pharmacology. I use the term shamanic snuffs because in most
cultures they are employed only by shamans, generally as an aid to divination,
although in some, such as many Waikd (Yanomamö) tribes of Venezuela and Brazil,
they are also used frequently in nonritual contexts by many or most male adults;
for other Waikás, shamanic snuffs are also used in hunting, as dart-poisons.
Extensive historical, phytochemical and entheobotanical detail on these snuffs
can be found in my book Shamanic Snuffs or Entheogenic Errhines (Ott 2001).</p>
<p>Nopo and yopo are generic terms mostly applicable scientifically to snuffs
derived from ground seeds of <a href="http://de1.erowid.org/plants/anadenanthera/anadenanthera.html" target="_blank"> Anadenanthera</a> peregrina (L.) Speg. var. peregrina
v. Reis Alt. (Leguminosae), which are of broad historical and contemporary use
in Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru (Torres 1996), and historical
use in the Greater Antilles, as cohoba. Related snuffs most commonly known as
cebíl or vilca, based on ground seeds of A. colubrina (Vel.) Bren. var. Cebil (Griseb.)
v. Reis Alt., were once common in the Peruvian montaña and south Andean region,
and are still used in the Chaco of Bolivia/Paraguay/Argentina, where they are
best known as hatáj (Torres &amp; Repke 1996). There is strong evidence that
shamanic snuffs (and enemas) were also prepared from Anadenanthera leaves,
perhaps an obsolete practice.</p>
<p>Anadenanthera snuffs are often known as paricá, a word I avoid, being a
generic term for South American shamanic snuffs, also applied to those derived
from barks of diverse Virola species (Myristicaceae), which are the subject of
my third paper (Ott In press; see also de Smet 1985a, b). Nopo being the
best-known term for Anadenanthera snuffs, and in keeping with pharmahuasca (my
neologism for ayahuasca analogues using pure alkaloids, which has achieved broad
acceptance), I denominate Anadenanthera snuff analogues pharmañopo.</p>
<p>There are a handful of published reports of psychonautic bioassays of
Anadenanthera snuffs prepared from both species. Pagés Larraya (1959) made
extensive tests of his own powder of crushed, toasted seeds of A. colubrina var.
Cebil, and described depersonalization and experiences of &quot;some mystery
surpassing known limits ... consubstantial with consciousness of the
numinous.&quot; Snuff expert C.M. Torres and I had tested our own preparations
of cebil-seed snuff from material we collected in Argentina; I experienced
&quot;sinuous, multihued, arabesque patterns, first viewed behind closed eyes,
then on a stuccoed wall in a darkened hallway, at length even on surfaces ...
illuminated via a skylight by the crepuscular, desert sun&quot; (Ott 1995).
Using the same material, Rätsch (1996) gave a compelling account of his
fantastic visionary experience, accompanied by drawings of sinuous,
pre-Columbian art motifs from México and Peru which he likened to his cebil-snuff
visions. Finally, Castillo (1997) described his insufflation of a yopo snuff
prepared by a Venezuelan Piaroa shaman (probably from A. peregrina var.
peregrina seeds), after having chewed a piece of capí liana (doubtless
Banisteriopsis caapi). This provoked a bizarre shamanic experience of
hyperaesthesia and hallucinations, leading the author to speculate on possible
&quot;emergence of a sixth sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Considerable chemical work on Anadenanthera shows conclusively and
consistently that bufotenine is the only significant alkaloid in mature seeds of
both species used for snuffs (Torres &amp; Repke 1996; de Smet &amp; Rivier
1987; Sdvio Nunes et al. 1987; Rend6n 1984; Schultes et al. 1977; Yamasato 1972;
Chagnon, Le Quesne &amp; Cook 1971; Fellows &amp; Bell 1971; Holmstedt &amp;
Lindgren 1967; Paris, Saint-Firmin &amp; Etchepare 1967; lacobucci &amp; Rdveda
1964; Giesbrecht 1960; Pachter, Zacharias &amp; Ribeiro 1959; Alvares Pereira
1957; Fish, Johnson &amp; Horning 1955; Stromberg 1954). Up to 7.4% bufotenine
has been found in seeds of A. peregrina var. peregrina, only 0.04% 5-MeO-DMT and
0.16% DMT; 12.4% bufotenine in A. colubrina var. Cebil, with but 0.06% and
traces of both tryptamines, respectively. Seven studies of 15 samples of
Anadenanthera snuffs likewise showed bufotenine to be the only tryptamine
present in significant amounts (up to 2.67%, with only traces of 5-MeO-DMT and
DMT) (Torres et al. 1991; de Smet &amp; Rivier 1985; Schultes et al. 1977; De
Budowski et al. 1974; Holmstedt &amp; Lindgren 1967; MariniBettblo, Delle
Monache &amp; Biocca 1964; Fish, Johnson &amp; Horning 1955). Inasmuch as there
is virtually no pharmacological information on bufotenine (or other natural
tryptamines) as errhine or snuff, I investigated intranasal pharmacology of this
snuff tryptamine. All bioassays were conducted by myself only, outside of the
United States, using bufotenine free-base I isolated from Anadenanthera seeds I
likewise had collected. In spite of bufotenine's Schedule I status in the United
States, no laws were violated, neither technically nor de facto, in the course
of this research - evidently only in the U.S. is bufotenine illicit; all
chemical and psychonautic work was conducted in countries in which bufotenine is
not a controlled substance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ON ETHICS AND PSYCHONAUTICS</p>
<p>The term psychonauts was first coined in German (Psychonauten) by Ernst
Jiffiger, in his logbook of pharmacological voyages in inner space - which he
named the psychocosmos (Ringer 1970). Of late the term psychonautic bioassay, to
refer to self-experiments with psychotropic drugs, has gained currency, and I
here employ the substantive psychonautics in characterizing such research. Some
might regard this to be a euphemism for getting stoned, mayhap with justice in
some cases, such as its common use by basement shamans (popularized as the name
of a botanical supply firm in Illinois) to describe non-novel, unstructured and
uncontrolled (and generally unreported) ingestion of psychotropic agents. On the
other hand, amateur reports posted on the Internet or in publications like The
Entheogen Review can be valuable sources of human pharmacological data, albeit
requiring winnowing of precious little wheat from abundant chaff.</p>
<p>Moreover, psychonautic bioassays have proven invaluable in phytochemical
investigation of visionary compounds. Although alkaloids had first been isolated
a decade before from péyotl, Lophophora williamsii (Lem.) Coult. (Cactaceae),
self-experiments by Arthur
Heffter in 1897 were required to determine that mescaline was the main visionary
agent. Based on animal assays, Sandoz Ltd. pharmacologists had in 1938 rejected LSD as lacking interest, but
intuition led Albert Hofmann to resynthesize the compound in 1943, provoking its accidental
ingestion and his subsequent psychonautic bioassay, hence the discovery of one of the most
potent drugs known. Hofmann later found animal assays useless to guide the isolation of visionary
compounds from Psilocybe mexicana Heim (Agaricaceae) and Turbina corymbosa (L.) Raf. (Convolvulaeae).
Although in both cases other groups had a head-start, Hofmann alone was
successful (finding psilocybine/psilocine and lysergic acid amides,
respectively), thanks to his use of psychonautic bioassays. While salvinorin A
was isolated pursuant to animal assays, it had previously been found during
research on novel terpenoids, and a decade passed before basement shamans
demonstrated conclusively it was the visionary agent of Salvia divinorum Epl. et Jativa (Labiatae)
(Siebert 1994).&nbsp;</p>
<p> Insofar as animal assays have proven ineffective in some areas of research on
visionary compounds, the ethics of their use is dubious. This goes double for
many types of research on so-called drugs of abuse, given the fact that these are studied owing to
their human popularity, pursuant to their subjective effects. Some proponents of purportedly
objective double-blind animal research dismiss psychonautic bioassays as being subjective, although
this is fundamental to scientific interest in many &quot;abused&quot; drugs. As Shulgin and
Shulgin (1991) have argued, ethics dictate that the researcher her- or himself be the first to ingest a novel,
putative psychotropic drug, and that subsequent human testing be conducted only
with fully-informed volunteers advised as to the identity of the compound, its
dose, and the nature of effects already experienced. The Shulgins denominate
such secondary testing &quot;double conscious&quot; (after Gordon Alles), and
characterize double-blind studies in these cases as &quot;pointless&quot; and
&quot;verg[ing] upon the unethical.&quot; In countries where a particular drug
is illegal (i.e., bufotenine in the U.S.), it might he argued that any testing
of it is unethical absent official authorization, although I would maintain it
would still be ethical to test it on oneself (albeit perforce entailing criminal
possession). Even in the case of a completely novel compound, whether natural or
artificial, any human ingestion or even its intent, is illegal in the U.S. under
the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986. As Shulgin (1992)
remarked: &quot;Explicit approval or exemption from the FDA must now precede
legal human research with new drugs.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>
<p>Bufotenine free-base was isolated and purified as described below, from a
mixed collection of A. colubrina var. Cebil gathered in Salta, Argentina, of
which representative specimens were botanically vouchered. Harmine hydrochloride
dihydrate and harmaline hydrochloride dihydrate were obtained from Acros Organics of Geel, Belgium.
Reagent-grade solvents
were utilized in the extraction of bufotenine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cebib-seed snuff was prepared by lightly toasting, then triturating to a
coarse powder, freshly collected seeds (with addition of reagent-grade sodium bicarbonate as a
drying agent to facilitate finer pulverization, and in emulation of shamanic use
of ashes or lime in Anadenanthera snuffs). Snuff analogues were made by finely
pulverizing (and in some cases mixing) the crystalline alkaloids.&nbsp;</p>
<p> In snuff bioassays, I first washed my nose with saline solution, which was
exsufflated followed by drying with tissue. Alkaloids were insufflated bilaterally through a short
glass tube, after which I reclined until the peak effects were perceived, at times elevating my
head to ensure the material did not enter my throat. For sublingual bioassays, the alkaloids
were again finely powdered on a glassine weighing paper from which they were
dropped under my tongue, which was first lowered to smear them around, after
which I would recline with my head propped up, my tongue positioned in the back
of my mouth to obviate salivary dilution, again until experiencing peak effects.
Oral experiments involved simply swallowing the encapsulated alkaloids. For
inhaled-vapor tests, bufotenine was weighed on a square of heavy-gauge aluminum
foil subsequently fashioned as a ball, into the opening of which the flared end
of a female ball-jointed glass tube would just fit. The material was vaporized over an
alcohol lamp, and the vapor retained for 45-60 seconds. Both foil and tube were later
weighed to ensure I had absorbed the entire dose. The bufotenine suppositories (in pharmaceutical
cocoa butter) were simply inserted intrarectally.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Careful notes were made of each experiment. At least a full day passed
between bioassays. My aim was always to ascertain the threshold dose for unmistakable visionary
effects (auditory and visual), so to minimize subjectivity in evaluating the
results - the
threshold can be noted accurately, whereas comparing stronger effects implies
subjective guesswork. Visionary effects of insufflated bufotenine were verified by one colleague well experienced
with Anadenanthera snuff, those of vaporized bufotenine by several volunteers. As yet, effects
of sublingual, oral and intrarectal bufotenine are unreplicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF VISIONARY TRYPTAMINES</p>
<p>Although visionary or psychoptic effects (generally colorful and luminous
patterns, either geometric or arabesque; at times also substantive visions) are
characteristic of psychoactive tryptamines, for me these are not prominent, in contrast to auditory effects
(usually high-pitched tinnitus and a much greater perceptive prominence of the
auditory sense) which in turn acquires higher discrimination and resolution of
actual sound sources, hence more &quot;depth.&quot; Truly physical effects are
barely perceptible, although bodily perception may be altered. Euphoria is the
best word to describe its effect on mood, although some people experience rather
anxiety and dysphoria. For me, there are no after-effects; far from a
&quot;crash&quot; or depression, I always feel stronger and healthier after (and
during) the experience. There is so much variation among individuals in the
effects of any given tryptamine that it is futile to generalize further. The
pharmacodynamics of bufotenine by distinct routes is discussed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="melt">ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION OF BUFOTENINE FREE-BASE</A></p>
<p>Coarse-ground powder of 125g of seeds of A. colubrina var. Cebil was stirred
twice for eight hours in 500 ml of 96% ethanol 1% tartaric acid, the combined
filtrates concentrated to 150 ml and diluted with 200 ml water in a separatory-funnel, causing precipitation
of considerable fat. The pH was adjusted to 3-4 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the
solution defatted by shaking six times with chloroform, which was set aside. The defatted extract
was basified to pH 8-9 with ammonium hydroxide, then again extracted eight times with 200 ml
chloroform; the combined chloroform extracts were concentrated to a foamy, yellowish oil that
dissolved completely in 50 ml hot ethyl acetate, then concentrated to 15 ml and
refrigerated overnight. In the morning there were a brace of minuscule rosettes of
dark-brownish
crystals growing at the base of the flask, which was alternated between periods under refrigeration
and standing unstoppered at room temperature during 48 hours, leading to the
formation of large masses (some greater than 1cm) of dark-brownish, prismatic crystals. The
mother-liquor was decanted and the crystalline mass rinsed with cold ethyl
acetate dried over magnesium sulfate, then dried under reduced pressure to yield 4.1 g of large,
free-flowing, sparkling
brownish crystals. These were twice recrystallized from dry ethyl acetate,
yielding 3.87 g of off-white bufotenine free-base crystals (3. 10%), m.p.
125-126&#176 C. Despite loss of chromophores on recrystallizations, the melting
point remained 124-126&#176. Six reports of isolated bufotenine free-base, from
Amanita citrina (Schaef.) Gray (Agaricaceae) (Wieland &amp; Motzel 1953) and
Anadenanthera species (Rendón 1984; lacobucci &amp; Rdveda 1964; Pachter,
Zacharias &amp; Ribeiro 1959; Alvares Pereira 1957; Stromberg 1954-yields
reported were from 0.94-7.4% for A. peregrina to 0.5-2.1 % for A. colubrina),
disclosed two crystalline isoforms from ethyl acetate, one melting from [123-]124-126[-129]&#176 C, the other
146-147[-150]&#176 C.
Two reports of synthetic material disclosed a third isoform, with melting points
of 138-140&#176 C (Stoll et al. 1955); and again 146-147&#176 C
(Speeter &amp; Anthony 1954). In all cases involving the lower-melting-point
isoforms, repeated purification did not alter the melting point, although
Iacobucci and Rdveda (1964), upon seeding a recrystallization-solution of their
lower melting point isoform (123-124&#176 C) with crystals having m.p. 146-147&#176 C,
got only crystals of the latter type, which operation was not reversible. By
manipulating conditions of recrystallization from ethyl acetate, I was able to
generate crystals melting at 145-147&#176 C, and
confirmed Iacobucci and RtIveda's observation. DMT free-base from hexane
likewise exists as at least three isoforms, melting points from 44-74&#176 C having
been reported, and Fish, Johnson and Horning (1956) replicated the irreversible
transformation of a lower-melting-point isoform (47-49&#176 C)
into a higher-melting-point isoform (71-73&#176 C). Identity and purity of isolated
bufotenine were verified by mass-spectral analysis and thin-layer
chromatographic comparison with an authentic sample in several solvent systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUFOTENINE-INTRANASAL PSYCHONAUTICS (BN)</p>
<p>Nine bioassays (BN-I through BN-IX, with dosages of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 80, and 100 mg, respectively) established the visionary parameters of
intranasal bufotenine. Insufflating 40 mg bufotenine free-base in BN-V led me to
the visionary threshold, while even 5, 10, 20 and 30 mg (BN1 through BN-IV) were
perceptibly psychoactive in every case, with closed-eye luminosity and
scintillation commencing at 20 mg (BN-III); whereas 30 mg in BN-IV was barely
subthreshold. The following pharmacodynamics are characteristic at 40 mg (0.57
mg/kg): first sign of activity, acouasm (tinnitus) at five minutes; clear
tryptaminic body effects at 25 minutes; peak between 35 and 40 minutes;
unmistakable diminution by 50 minutes; and evanescent after effects up to 90
minutes. Like cebil-seeds snuffed and smoked, intranasal bufotenine is
throughout quite physically relaxing; in no case was there facial rubescence,
nor any discomfort nor disesteeming side-effect. BN-VI through BN-VIII (50, 60,
80 mg) gave progressively stronger effects with similar pharmacodynamics. In BN-IX (100 mg; 1.43 mg/kg), colored patterns with eyes closed presented at 15
minutes, much as I had experienced with ground cebil-seed snuff in Chile.
Inasmuch as shamanic snuffs are often combined with beta-carboline containing
Banisteriopsis liana powder (Ott 2001), BN-X through BN-XIII involved
combinations of bufotenine freebase with both harmine and harmaline, as
hydrochloride dihydrate salts (all beta-carboline doses are given as free-base
equivalents). Previous research with 5-MeO-DMT and beta-carbolines, which will
be reported forthwith (Ott In press), had established that even minuscule doses
of harmine and harmaline effectively doubled the intranasal potency of this
tryptamine, with as little as 3.7mg (0.05 mg/kg) halving the visionary threshold
dose. This proved to be the case for bufotenine as well. In BN-XII, for
instance, 50 mg bufotenine (0.71 mg/kg) insufflated with 7.5 mg harmine (0.11
mg/kg) proved to be more potent than 80 mg plain bufotenine (BN-VIII) and
roughly commensurate with 100 mg (BN-IX). While bufotenine decidedly has the
tryptamine signature, its psychoptic effects are unique and eminently
distinguishable from those of DMT or 5-MeO-DMT. In the first place, some are
evident only in low-light conditions, and might be missed in darkness, such as a
shimmery &quot;magical varnish&quot; (to borrow Baudelaire's bon mot) over the
world, which seems to breathe, accompanied as this is by susurrant and
synaesthetic psithurism, and occasionally a sudden and dramatic dimming of the
visual field, as though the starting of a heavy motor had dropped line-voltage
and dimmed the lights. On the other hand, at the highest doses tested, there are
swirling, colored patterns typical of tryptamines, tending toward the arabesque,
whereas for me at very high doses of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, geometric psychoptic
patterns sometimes manifest. With bufotenine there is also an occasional and
curious &quot;strobe -effect&quot; in low light, which I have never experienced
with either of its visionary congeners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUFOTENINE-SUBLINGUAL PSYCHONAUTICS (BS)</p>
<p>Like 5-MeO-DMT, sublingual bufotenine proved to be Equipotent with intranasal
ingestion, having virtually the same pharmacodynamics, and likewise susceptible
to doubling of potency with similar doses of beta-carbolines. In BS-II, 50 mg
bufotenine (0.71 mg/kg) plus 7.5 mg harmaline (0. 11 mg/kg), was considerably
stronger than BS-I (50 mg bufotenine neat) and roughly equipotent with BN-XII (50
mg bufotenine plus 7.5 mg harmine, intranasally).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUFOTENINE-ORAL PSYCHONAUTICS (BO)</p>
<p>There are various reports of oral ingestion of Anadenanthera seeds, whether
as a simple masticatory or as an additive to alcoholic chichas, ranging from the
Peruvian montaña to central Argentina, and from the epoch of the conquest to
the twentieth century. Both Hofmann (1999: 1963) and Isbell (in correspondence
to Wassén &amp; Holmstedt 1963) had reported that bufotenine was inactive
orally. Hofmann, based on personal bioassays of up to a 50 mg dose (ca. 0.8
mg/kg); Isbell referring vaguely to &quot;doses running up to 100 mg (total
dose),&quot; implying that this amount was given fractionally, without
specifying individual doses. In BO-I, I ingested 100mg bufotenine free-base
(1.43 mg/kg) encapsulated, to preclude any contact with my buccal mucosa - this
dose was most decidedly psychoactive. The first activity, tinnitus, manifested
at 20 minutes, developed slowly and lasted some two hours. The peak was attained
at one hour 30 minutes with all the classic tryptaminic bodily sensations and
mild psychoptic effects, but absent colored patterns. In BO-II, I swallowed a
capsule containing 20 mg bufotenine (0.28 mg/kg) plus 40 mg harmaline
(0.57mg/kg) I'd already established per pharmahuasca bioassays such quantity
orally activated DMT for me, although I am a low-MAO phenotype, and most require
about 50% more) this proved to be nearly as potent as BO-I, with virtually
identical pharmacodynamics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INHALED-VAPOR BUFOTENINE PSYCHONAUTICS (BV)</p>
<p>Both species of Anadenanthera used as snuffs have also reportedly been used
as fumatories, especially cebíl seeds, which presently in the Chaco are more
commonly smoked than snuffed (generally with tobacco); shamans assert they are
more active thus (Torres &amp; Repke 1996), which I and others in my presence
have verified. Tryptamines as a rule are more active via inhalation of freebase
vapor than orally or intranasally, and this proved to be the case for bufotenine
as well. In five bioassays, I tested increasing doses of inhaled, vaporized
bufotenine free-base. BV-11 through BV-V involved inhalation of 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg
bufotenine (0.03-0.11 mg/kg), respectively. All doses were decidedly
psychoactive, increasing in potency proportional to dosage, with roughly the
same pharmacodynamics save time of onset, which decreased in proportion to
increased dosage (45, 35, 25 and 18 seconds, respectively). The first clear
signal (acouasm) was at two minutes; peaks were attained at four to five
minutes, unmistakable attenuation by seven to nine minutes, with diminishing
effects evident for a full hour. In BV-11 through BV-IV, psychoptic effects were
limited to that low-light, shimmery &quot;magical varnish&quot; over the world
not evident in darkness and attended by synaesthetic psithurism; while in BV-V
(8 mg), at seven to eight minutes there were also ring-like, swirling, colored
patterns with eyes closed; visible, albeit fainter, with eyes opened in low
light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUFOTENINE-INTRARECTAL PSYCHONAUTICS (BR)</p>
<p>De Smet (1985b; 1983) has extensively reviewed the evidence for shamanic
enema-injection, which is strong and incontrovertible in the case of infusions
of Anadenanthera seeds and leaves; accordingly I resolved to bioassay
intrarectal bufotenine. De Smet (1983) bioassayed doses as high as 125 mg DMT
(as less than 185 mg bioxalate salt in 15 ml water; ca. 2.0 mg/kg) intrarectally,
which were &quot;without any discernible effect&quot;-I suspect such high doses
of the free-base would have been dramatically active. It's unclear why de Smet
chose to bioassay DMT thus, and not bufotenine or 5-MeO-DMT, which would have
figured in reported shamanic enemas based on Anadenanthera seeds and leaves, respectively. Only in the
hypothetical case of shamanic enemas based on leaves of Virola (Ott 2001) - in which it is the predominant
tryptamine - might DMT likely be of importance, but Virola-leaf enemas have not
been reported (only Virola leafen snuffs). For BR-I, I triturated 30 mg
bufotenine (0.43 mg/kg) with 0.25 g sodium bicarbonate into 1.0 g of cocoa
butter. Mild physical effects developed quickly and lasted roughly an hour. For
BR-11, I inserted an identical suppository with addition of 10 mg harmaline,
which proved to have subthreshold effects. Finally, in BR-III, a 50 mg (0.71
mg/kg) bufotenine suppository with 10 mg harmaline, thresholdlevel psychoptic
effects resulted. Initial tinnitus commencing at 15 minutes led to closed-eye
scintillation and luminosity at the peak, around 45 minutes, followed by the
characteristic, shimmery &quot;magical varnish&quot; over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISCUSSION AND COMMENTARY</p>
<p>While referring the reader to my comprehensive book (Ott 2001) for fuller
details and background on these bioassays, by way of summary I note that at
least two species of <a href="http://de1.erowid.org/plants/anadenanthera/anadenanthera.html" target="_blank"> Anadenanthera</a>: A. peregrina var. peregrina and A. colubrina
var. Cebil have been used virtually throughout South America and the Caribbean
in archaic, historical and contemporary times, as snuffs, fumatories,
masticatories, potions and enemas derived from the seeds, and at least as snuffs
and enemas made from leaves of the former. Setting aside poorly-documented
leafen snuffs/enemas (in which the important tryptamine is probably 5-MeO-DMT),
rather extensive phytochemical work points inexorably and consistently to
bufotenine as by far the major tryptamine in Anadenanthera seeds and snuffs,
which may contain only insignificant amounts of secondary compounds such as 5-MeO-DMT
and DMT. Nevertheless, thanks to perverse, inconclusive, and frankly
unethical experiments on convicts and mental patients in the U.S. and Argentina
in the 1950s and 1960s (incarcerated subjects cannot render freely informed
consent and may be coerced, while mental patients may not even be asked - many of
these experiments provoked circulatory crises, facial lividity described as the
color of an eggplant or a plum, and at least one led to cardiac arrest,
necessitating resuscitative measures), bufotenine has been dismissed far and
wide as a supposititious psychoptic agent in these shamanic inebriants. <A NAME="debate">Indeed</A>,
in these very pages, an article outstanding for its repetitive wrong-headedness
stated no fewer than 16 times that bufotenine was: &quot;not psychedelic,&quot;
&quot;not hallucinogenic&quot; and &quot;not psychoactive&quot; -the authors,
one of whom is a chemist, eschewing the simple expedient of psychonautic
bioassays of bufotenine (which is quite easy to isolate or synthesize, and
appears to be a controlled substance only in the United States), which would
have saved them this embarrassing error (<a href="abstracts.htm.html" target="_blank">Lyttle, Goldstein &amp; Gartz
1996</a>).
Although they cited Turner &amp; Merlis (1959) review of Isbell's research, they
suppressed the detail that his subjects had experienced: &quot;a play of colors,
lights, and patterns&quot; following intramuscular injection of bufotenine; then
listed (without citing) the report by Bonhour, Fischer &amp; Melgar (1967),
which likewise had referred clearly to &quot;hallucinogenic&quot; effects of
intravenously-injected bufotenine. Others have endeavored to explain away the
phytochemical and psychonautic evidence concerning Anadenanthera by
hypothesizing, absent a shred of proof and again unsupported by bioassays, that
human beings must possess in sinuses and lungs an enzyme like 0-methyl-transferase, which in only one known species of toad (Bufo alvarius Gir.)
methylates bufotenine to its 0-methyl congener, 5-MeODMT, which compound would
rather be responsible for the psychoptic effects of Anadenanthera preparations.
Besides failing the test of scientific parsimony, this notion is as unlikely as
it is unsubstantiated. Based on my extensive personal experience with
bufotenine, 5-MeO-DMT and their plant sources, I deem it improbable in the
extreme - I would have no trouble distinguishing bufotenine from 5-MeO-DMT by any
route of ingestion (indeed, I very much like the latter and dislike the former).
It goes without saying that haphazard human intravenous-bufotenine experiments
by Fabing and Hawkins (1956), (Isbell) Turner and Merlis (1959) and Bonhour,
Fischer &amp; Melgar (1967) are of scant relevance to Anadenanthera
pharmacology, besides violating the code of medical ethics adumbrated in the
Nornberg War Crimes Tribunals (which mandates informed consent for human
studies). Although Isbell, and Turner and Merlis (1959) conducted some crude and
desultory tests involving intranasal bufotenine, the doses employed were too low
(no more than 14.3 mg free-base equivalent), they unwisely used a water-soluble
salt, and frankly were quite at sea with this sort of research, which they
didn't adequately report, much less follow-up. Similarly, doses employed
intranasally of what I call &quot;National Institutes of Health-&quot; or &quot;NIH-snuff&quot;
prepared there by Fish (Fish &amp; Horning 1956; Fish, Johnson &amp; Horning
1955) were far too low (no more than 560 mg, containing 6 mg bufotenine). This
was also the case for Isbell's and Hofmann's (1963) preliminary oral experiments
- I hasten to underscore that Hofmann's involved fully ethical,
personal psychonautic bioassays, by an eminently qualified expert who knew
better than anyone what he was doing.</p>
<p>I think my evidence, although it of course requires further confirmation by
others, is conclusive and consistent - there is no reason to look beyond
bufotenine, by far their major tryptamine, for the psychoptic agent of shamanic
Anadenanthera preparations, whether snuffed, smoked, swallowed, sucked or
inserted rectally. I very much doubt anyone with a modicum of experience with
tryptamines would have difficulty distinguishing bufotenine from other
tryptamines, with which it nonetheless shares some commonalities. As inhaled
free-base vapor it is roughly equipotent with 5-MeO-DMT, and some four- or
five-fold more potent than DMT; as errhine or sublingually it is roughly
equipotent with DMT and some several-fold weaker than 5-MeO-DMT. This generally
holds for oral ingestion as well, with the provision that orally, DMT (at least
up to a 1.0 g dose) requires activation by MAOI, whereas in sufficient dosage,
both bufotenine and 5-MeO-DMT (Ott In press) are impressively active orally by
themselves. Given our contemporary fixation on DMT and the so-called
&quot;ayahuasca effect,&quot; mayhap this will surprise many, but it oughtn't.
With regard to oral activity, DMT is the exception, not the rule, among
tryptamines. Of some 30 simple tryptamines reported to be psychoactive by
Shulgin and Shulgin (1997), 28 were active orally (correcting for bufotenine and
5-MeO-DMT), and the only other exception simply had not been tried orally.</p>
<p>Nor ought the comparatively high activity of bufotenine as inhaled vapor, and
correspondingly low activity by other routes, surprise us (see Table 1). It has
been established that bufotenine passes the blood-brain barrier with difficulty,
and setting aside intravenous injection of tryptamines (in all events, hardly
germane to the pharmacology of shamanic snuffs; vide Ott 1999), inhaled vapor
effects the most efficient passage of tryptamines through the blood-brain
barrier; although at least with respect to psychoptic effects, bufotenine would
seem to be more psychoactive as inhaled vapor than via intravenous injection
(perhaps due to binding by profuse serotonin receptors in the vascular system
and on blood cells), Animal research has shown that once in the brain,
bufotenine has more &quot;LSD-like activity&quot; than does 5-MeO-DMT, itself
more active than DMT, which is what their chemical structures might lead us to
expect (Glennon et al. 1979). Indeed, in rat fundus-strip preparations,
bufotenine had twice the serotonine receptor affinity of 5-MeO-DMT (Glennon
&amp; Gessner 1975).</p>
<p>As for intranasal activity of other psychoptic tryptamines, Shulgin &amp;
Shulgin (1997) reported that N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine or MIPT is active
intranasally at 20 mg; N,N-diethyltryptamine or DET likewise at about 100 mg (Gartz
1999); while several reports from basement shamans are consistent regarding
intranasal activity of N,N-dipropyltryptamine or DPT from 35-200 mg (Case 1999;
Gwyllm 1999; Toad 1999). All three of these compounds remain artificial, and are
likewise active orally. As documented in my third paper in this series (Ott In
press), the natural snuff tryptamine 5-MeO-DMT similarly is active intranasally
- forthwith I shall document also intranasal activity of DMT.&nbsp;</p>
