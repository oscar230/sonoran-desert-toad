  <p align="center">The Perfect Toad
  </p>

  <p align="center">The sun caught the pond<br>
    In the second of sky<br>
    With its boreas down<br>
    And its cumuli dry</p>

  <p align="center">Fast asleep<br>
    On the edge of the pond<br>
    A toad felt the touch<br>
    Of a second of sun</p>

  <p align="center">He opened his eyes<br>
    and raised his head<br>
    At this precise moment<br>
    I'm perfect he said</p>

  <p align="center">He closed his eyes<br>
    And destroyed the view<br>
    I'm perfect he thought<br>
    At this moment too.</p>

  <p align="left">warty bliggens the toad<br>
    <br>
    i met a toad<br>
    the other day by the name<br>
    of warty bliggens<br>
    he was sitting under<br>
    a toadstool<br>
    feeling contented<br>
    he explained that when the cosmos<br>
    was created<br>
    that toadstool was especially<br>
    planned for his personal<br>
    shelter from sun and rain<br>
    thought out and prepared<br>
    for him<br>
    <br>
    do not tell me<br>
    said warty bliggens<br>
    that these is not a purpose<br>
    in the universe<br>
    the thought is blasphemy<br>
    <br>
    a little more<br>
    conversation revealed<br>
    that warty bliggens considers himself to be<br>
    the center of the said<br>
    universe<br>
    the earth exists<br>
    to grow toadstools for him<br>
    to sit under<br>
    the sun to give him light<br>
    by day and the moon<br>
    and wheeling constellations<br>
    to make beautiful<br>
    the night for the sake of<br>
    warty bliggens<br>
    <br>
    to what act of yours<br>
    do impute<br>
    this interest on the part<br>
    of the creator<br>
    of the universe<br>
    i asked him<br>
    why is it that you<br>
    are so greatly favored<br>
    <br>
    ask rather<br>
    said warty bliggens<br>
    what the universe<br>
    has done to deserve me<br>
    if i were a<br>
    human being i would<br>
    not laugh<br>
    too complacently<br>
    at poor warty bliggens<br>
    for similar<br>
    absurdities<br>
    have only too often<br>
    lodged in the crinkles<br>
    of the human cerebrum<br>
    <br>

  <p align="center">THE TOAD</p>

  <p align="left">Old fellow loiterer, whither wouldst thou go?&nbsp;<br>
    The lonely eve is ours,&nbsp;<br>
    When tides of richer fragrance ooze and flow&nbsp;<br>
    From heavy-lidded flowers.<br>
    <br>
    With solemn hampered pace proceeding by<br>
    The dewy garden bed,<br>
    Like some old priest in antique finery,<br>
    Stiff cope and jewelled head;<br>
    <br>
    Thy sanctuary lamps are lit at dusk,<br>
    Where leafy isles are dim;<br>
    The bat's shrill piccolo, the swinging musk<br>
    Blend with the beetle's hymn.<br>
    <br>
    Ay, something paramount and priestly too,<br>
    Some cynic mystery,<br>
    Lurks in thy dull skin with its dismal hue,<br>
    Thy bright ascetic eye;<br>
    <br>
    Thou seemest the heir of centuries, hatched out<br>
    With aeons on thy track;<br>
    The dusk of ages compasses about<br>
    Thy lean and shrivelled back.<br>
    <br>
    Thy heaving throat, thy sick repulsive glance<br>
    Still awes thy foes around;<br>
    The eager hound starts back and looks askance,<br>
    And, whining, paws the ground.<br>
    <br>
    Yet thou hast forfeited thy ancient ban,<br>
    Thy mystical control;<br>
    We know thee now to be the friend of man,<br>
    A simple homely soul;<br>
    <br>
    And when we deemed thee curiously wise,<br>
    Still chewing venomed paste,<br>
    Thou didst but crush the limbs of juicy flies<br>
    With calm and critic taste.<br>
    <br>
    By the grey stone half-sunk inn mossy mould,<br>
    Beside the stiff box-hedge,<br>
    Thou slumberest, when the dawn with fingers cold<br>
    Plucks at the low cloud's edge.<br>
    <br>
    O royal life! in some cool cave all day,<br>
    Dreaming old dreams, to lie,<br>
    Or peering up to see the larkspur sway<br>
    Above thee in the sky;<br>
    <br>
    Or wandering when the sunset airs are cool<br>
    Beside the elm-tree's foot,<br>
    To splash and sink in some sequestered pool<br>
    Amid the cresses' root.<br>
    <br>
    Abhorred, despised, the sad wind o'er thee sings;<br>
    Thou hast no friend to fear,<br>
    Yet fashioned in the secret mint of things<br>
    And bidden to be here.<br>
    <br>
    Man dreams of loveliness, and bids it be;<br>
    To truth his eye is dim.<br>
    Thou wert, because the spirit dreamed of thee<br>
    And thou art born of him.<br>
    <br>
    Arthur Christopher Benson<br>
