    <p><b>Bufo Toads and Bufotenine: Fact and Fiction Surrounding an Alleged
            Psychedelic</b><br>
        by T. Lyttle; D. Goldstein; J. Gartz<br>
        Journal of Psychoactive Drugs Vol. 28 (3): 267-290
    </p>
    <p><b>Abstract:</b>
        <br>
        This paper investigates the supposedly psychedelic Bufo toad and the allegedly psychedelic drug bufotenine,
        which is contained in the skin and glands of this toad. The bufo toad has held a place in human mythologies and
        medicines worldwide since archaic times. Used by ancient peoples for a variety of purposes, its most spectacular
        effects, according to lore, involve magical and shamanic or occult uses for casting spells and for divination.
        In the Middle Ages, the Bufo toad was celebrated as a panacea and persecuted as a powerful poison. More
        recently, in the 1960s the Bufo toad was resurrected as a countercultural icon, with people purportedly licking
        or smoking the secretions to get high. Bufotenine has been at the center of a scientific debate since its
        discovery in 1893. This paper examines the extensive literature surrounding the Bufo toad and bufotenine, and
        untangles many of the myths and the misinformation that continue to vex both science and popular reporting.
        Finally, to promote further investigation, a comprehensive bibliography is provided that charts the history of
        the Bufo toad and
        bufotenine.&nbsp;

            Abstract:</b><br>
        A review of the neuropharmacology of the alleged hallucinogen bufotenine is
        presented, including recent experimental results showing activity similar to LSD
        and other known hallucinogens (psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT) at the purported
        hallucinogenic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. In addition,
        current reports of computer modeling of the receptors and ligand binding sites
        give evidence of bufotenine's ability to bind and activate these receptors.
        While binding and activation of the purported hallucinogenic receptors are not
        the full extent of the hallucinogenic signature, this evidence shows support for
        the rationale that the reported lack of the drug's classic hallucinogenic
        response in human experiments is due to poor ability to cross the blood brain
        barrier (BBB), not lack of activation of the appropriate brain receptors.
        Further evidence is reviewed that in some physiological states, some drugs with
        characteristics similar to bufotenine which do not normally cross the BBB, cross
        it and enter the brain. While direct human experimental evidence of bufotenine's
        hallucinogenic activity seems lacking, the above combined factors are
        considered, and possible explanations of bufotenine's reported psychoactivity
        are suggested. Additionally, updated experimental models testing the possible
        nature of bufotenine's hallucinogenic potential are proposed.

        This author proposes some pretty outrageous ideas, so I sent him the following letter.

    <p>Dear Mr. McBride:</p>
    <p>I just finished reading your article, Bufotenine: Toward an Understanding of
        Possible Psychoactive Mechanisms in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs.
        July_September, 2000; 32 (3): 321_331.</p>
    <p>I am very interested to learn if anyone has informed you that they have
        smoked the venom of Bufo marinus, or used it in an enema, as you suggest in your
        paper. If so, what results have been obtained? I hope you won�t mind sharing
        this information with me.</p>
    <p>As you know, there is much confusion surrounding the topic of a psychoactive
        toad. My understanding regarding the B. marinus is that it can be very toxic, even
        to man. If its venom is in fact smokeable, as is the venom of B. alvarius, this
        is very important information indeed. However, if its venom is NOT smokeable
        because it�s unsafe - this is even more important to know.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you will find the time to
        respond.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Albert Most</p>
