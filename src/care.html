    <p><A name="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</A></p>
    <p>Amphibians and reptiles differ in many respects from the mammals and birds
      most commonly used in biomedical research. These differences affect the physical
      and biological requirements of amphibians and reptiles in captivity. In this
      contribution, some basic biological characteristics of these animals are
      described that are relevant to their husbandry. My goal is to help members of
      institutional animal care and use committees appreciate the requirements of
      amphibians and reptiles in captivity, and to make suggestions that will be
      helpful in designing housing and providing day-to-day care.</p>
    <p>I will focus on amphibians and reptiles used for research and teaching in
      colleges and universities. In the sense that amphibians and reptiles are exotic
      animals in a biomedical context, there are parallels between their use in
      academic settings and in zoos and aquariums. However, the facilities and
      resources available at colleges and universities are more limited than those of
      most zoos and aquariums. These recommendations address the limitations and
      opportunities of small-scale husbandry.</p>
    <p>The husbandry practices suggested here are compatible with the Health
      Extension Act (PL-99-158), with the National Research Council's <u>Guide for the
        Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</u> (NRC, 1985) with the Canadian Council on
      Animal Care's <u>Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals</u> (Canadian
      Council on Animal Care, 1980) and with the <u>Guidelines for Use of Live
        Amphibians and Reptiles in Field Research</u> (American Society of
      Ichthyologists and Herpetologists et al., 1987).</p>
    <p><A name="AMPHIBIANS">AMPHIBIANS</A> AND REPTILES IN RESEARCH AND TEACHING</p>
    <p>Understanding the husbandry requirements of amphibians and reptiles begins
      with understanding why these animals, rather than traditional biomedical
      species, are being studied. Studies of amphibians and reptiles often have
      different perspectives and goals than those using traditional biomedical
      species. These differences are reflected in the housing and care that is
      appropriate for the animals. In addition, the physical and biological needs of
      amphibians and reptiles differ from those of mammals and birds, and are often
      more difficult to provide in an artificial setting. Both of these factors must
      be appreciated by investigators working with these animals, and by the
      individuals responsible for evaluating protocols and husbandry practices.</p>
    <b>
      <p>The Context of Study</p>
    </b>
    <p>Many studies of amphibians and reptiles have an organismal perspective. That
      is, the focus of study is the intact animal and the context is the species as it
      functions in its natural environment. This approach differs from the traditional
      biomedical use of mammals and birds to illustrate general biological phenomena
      or to serve as models of specific human diseases or genetic defects. In
      organismal research, behavior, ecology, physiology, and morphology are studied
      in the context of phylogenetic relationships and environmental specializations.
      Husbandry must consider the entire biology of an organism so that normal
      behavior, physiological response, and morphogenesis can be assured. Much
      research in organismal biology is currently directed to comparative studies that
      investigate the evolution of physiological, morphological, and behavioral
      characteristics by studying a series of species (see Brooks and McLennan, 1991;
      Harvey and Pagel, 1991; and Huey, 1987 for examples of this approach). Studies
      of this sort rely upon measuring the same phenomenon (e.g., thermoregulation,
      parental care, or feeding mechanics) in several species. Reviewers of protocols
      must understand that the study of multiple species of known phylogenetic
      relationship is an essential element of the comparative approach, and is not
      duplication in the sense prohibited by National Institutes of Health
      regulations.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Practical Considerations</p>
    </b>
    <p>Providing environments suitable for amphibians and reptiles can be difficult.
      Domestic animals used in biomedical research have been bred to prosper under
      conditions that can easily be maintained in an animal room. Amphibians and
      reptiles, on the other hand, are wild animals, and the husbandry methods applied
      to them must take this into account. Housing, food, and care must match the
      physical and behavioral needs of each species. Carefully designed physical and
      biological environments are often needed, especially when the goal of husbandry
      is to facilitate studies of complex responses such as hormonal cycles,
      reproductive and social behavior, or water and temperature regulation. The
      welfare of the animals must have the highest priority in the design of animal
      rooms, cages, and cage furnishings. This effort must not be frustrated by the
      application of inappropriate standards based on domestic species.</p>
    <p>Because most species of amphibians and reptiles are not available on short
      notice or from commercial breeding colonies, they are usually either collected
      from the wild by the investigators themselves, or obtained by gift from other
      researchers, from zoos, or from agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
      Service. The availability of a species is likely to be affected by its seasonal
      activity cycle, the opportunity to collect in an exotic locality, and the
      provisions of national laws and international treaties. An investigator who
      plans to travel thousands of miles cannot predict in advance exactly how many
      individuals of which species will be collected. As a consequence of this
      uncertainty, investigators may have to submit protocols that include several
      taxa, only a few of which will actually be used. Furthermore, unusual species
      that have been successfully acclimated to laboratory conditions have a
      scientific value that transcends the project for which they were originally
      collected, and they may be kept indefinitely in expectation of further use.
      Animal care and use committees must understand these practical aspects of
      working with amphibians and reptiles and evaluate protocols accordingly.</p>
    <p><A name="BIOLOGY">THE BIOLOGY</A> OF AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES</p>
    <p>In order to design appropriate environments for amphibians and reptiles, one
      must have an appreciation for their unique biological characteristics. Some
      practices and materials that are suitable and desirable for the care of birds
      and mammals are unimportant or even deleterious for amphibians and reptiles.
      Conversely, considerations that have little relevance for birds and mammals can
      be crucial for successful husbandry of amphibians and reptiles. A large
      literature shows that husbandry practices that are appropriate for mammals are
      not suitable for amphibians and reptiles, but the pertinent references are
      scattered. Recent sources of general information about amphibians and reptiles
      include Bellairs (1969), National Academy of Sciences (1974), Harless and
      Morlock (1979), Stewart (1984a,b), Duellman and Trueb (1986), Halliday and Adler
      (1986), Seigel et al. (1987), Norris and Jones (1987), and Pough et al. (1989)
      and the references therein.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Distinctive Characteristics</p>
    </b>
    <p>Two attributes of amphibians and reptiles underlie all aspects of their care:
      Ectothermy and diversity.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Ectothermy.
    </b> Amphibians and reptiles are ectotherms, that is, they do not
    ordinarily generate enough metabolic heat to raise their body temperatures above
    the ambient temperature. However, ectotherms are not literally &quot;cold
    blooded.&quot; Under normal conditions, terrestrial ectotherms regulate body
    temperature by behavioral means, often at high levels and within narrow limits.
    Several important implications for their care follow from this aspect of their
    biology. Most importantly, environmental conditions are quite different from
    those appropriate for birds and mammals.</p>
    <p>Ectothermy is an energy efficient mode of thermoregulation because metabolic
      energy is not used to warm the body. As a result, the resting metabolic rates,
      aerobic capacities, and overall energy needs of ectotherms are nearly an order
      of magnitude lower than those of endotherms (birds and mammals) of similar size
      (Figure 1).</p>
    <p>The thermoregulatory mechanisms employed by amphibians and reptiles are by no
      means simple. Many ectotherms regulate their body temperatures during activity
      at levels that are similar to those of birds and mammals (35
  </font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C
    to 42</font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C). The
    regulated temperature may change in response to internal and external
    conditions. Changes in thermoregulatory behavior include differences between
    daytime and nighttime temperature, elevation of body temperature following
    feeding, an increase or decrease in body temperature during pregnancy, a
    behavioral fever mediated by prostaglandin release during bacterial infection,
    and muscular thermogenesis during egg brooding (Hutchison et al., 1966; Regal,
    1966, 1967; Lillywhite et al., 1973; Vaughn et al., 1974; Van Mierop and
    Barnard, 1976, 1978; Kluger, 1977, 1979; Hutchison and Erskine, 1981;
    Bartholomew, 1982; Beuchat, 1986; Sievert, 1989). Humane care of amphibians and
    reptiles requires conditions that facilitate their complex thermoregulatory
    responses.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Diversity.
    </b> Living ectothermal tetrapods include nearly 4,000 species of
    amphibians and 6,000 species of reptiles, encompassing nearly 10,000 species of
    animals that display an enormous array of lifestyles. This diversity makes these
    animals attractive for research at the cellular or molecular level, as well as
    for studying organismal, ecological, and evolutionary questions (Deuchar, 1975;
    Greenberg et al., 1989; Pough, 1989; Elinson et al., 1990). For example, an
    investigator studying hormonal control of reproductive behavior can choose from
    some 3500 species of anurans (frogs and toads). Among these are species that
    retain an ancestral amphibian life cycle (terrestrial adults, aquatic eggs, and
    aquatic larvae); terrestrial species in which either males or females carry
    developing eggs and/or young on the back, in vocal pouches, and even in the
    stomach; species in which females feed their tadpoles unfertilized eggs; and
    species that give birth to live young, either with or without some form of
    matrotrophic contribution to the fetus. Moreover, anurans run the gamut from
    totally aquatic frogs to species that live in deserts. Reptiles show still
    greater diversity in habitats and specializations. Because the ecological
    characteristics and husbandry requirements of the animals are so diverse, it is
    impossible to formulate specific guidelines for groups larger than a few
    species. In fact, broad application of specific guidelines would inhibit rather
    than promote humane care.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Sources of Information</p>
    </b>
    <p>The husbandry requirements of amphibians and reptiles in an academic setting
      are similar to those in zoos and aquariums (Gans and Van den Sande, 1976; Gans,
      1979; Murphy and Campbell, 1987; Murphy and Chiszar, 1989), and research in zoos
      has been a fruitful source of information about amphibians and reptiles (Sajdak,
      1983). Publications for herpetological hobbyists often provide useful guides for
      care of ectothermal vertebrates (e.g., Mattison, 1982, 1988; Obst et al., 1988;
      de Vosjoli, 1989, 1990). Journals like <u>Lacerta</u>, <u>Reptile &amp;
        Amphibian Magazine</u>, <u>Salamandra</u>, and <u>Vivarium</u>). <u>Herpetological
        Review</u>, published by the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles,
      has a section on &quot;Herpetological Husbandry.&quot; The <u>International Zoo
        Yearbook</u> usually contains sections about amphibians and reptiles, and much
      of Volume 28 (1989) of this series was devoted to their care. Symposia,
      newsletters, and special publications of herpetological societies are also
      helpful sources of information (e.g., Bowler, 1977; Murphy and Armstrong, 1978;
      Ferner, 1979; Murphy and Collins, 1980; Gray and Bumgardner, 1984; Gray, 1985;
      Gowen, 1987, 1989; and the Bulletin of the Association of Amphibian and
      Reptilian Veterinarians). The professional staff at zoos and aquariums can often
      provide advice about the husbandry requirements of a particular species. Such
      advice may be particularly helpful in establishing breeding programs. Slavens
      (1989) publishes an annually-updated inventory of reptiles and amphibians in
      zoos and private collections; this volume can lead to an appropriate source of
      information about a particular species.</p>
    <p>The diversity exhibited by amphibians and reptiles presents problems for
      husbandry that are not encountered with domestic and laboratory birds and
      mammals. Husbandry conditions must match the needs of the species being kept.
      Three factors are essential to achieve that goal:</p>
    <p>1. Knowledge of the natural history of each species, obtained from field
      observations or from the literature;</p>
    <p>2. Duplication of the features of the animals' natural microhabitats that are
      crucial for normal behavior and physiological function; and</p>
    <p>3. Awareness and sensitivity on the part of caretakers to the unique
      requirements of these animals and the ways in which they manifest ill-health.</p>
    <p><A name="GENERAL">GENERAL</A> RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CARE OF ECTOTHERMAL VERTEBRATES</p>
    <p>The following generalizations apply to the care of most amphibians and
      reptiles, but caution must be employed in their use. The taxonomic categories
      included are broad, and substantial variation exists within them. Some lizards,
      for example, are heliothermic and regulate their body temperatures between 38
      and 42
  </font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C, whereas
    others live beneath the canopies of tropical forests with body temperatures that
    fluctuate between 25 and 30</font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C.
    Still others are nocturnal and active at body temperatures below 20'C.
    Similarly, some amphibians are entirely aquatic, whereas others may never see a
    body of water larger than a pool of rain drops on a leaf. While these guidelines
    emphasize the factors that are likely to be important for husbandry and point to
    general categories of problems and solutions, information about the ecology and
    physiology of the species being kept is indispensable.</p>
    <b>
      <p><A name="PHYSICAL">The Physical</A> Environment</p>
    </b>
    <p>Housing conditions must provide appropriate temperature, moisture, and light
      regimes. In general, these include visible and ultraviolet light controlled on a
      daily and seasonal cycle, water for drinking or bathing, and high relative
      humidity. High rates of air flow are not usually required in animal rooms
      housing amphibians and reptiles. Limiting the number of air changes per hour
      greatly simplifies the task of maintaining high humidities. In most cases the
      key to successful care of amphibians and reptiles lies in providing a gradient
      of conditions within the cage that allowing animals to combinations of
      environmental factors needed.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Temperature.
    </b> The thermoregulatory requirements of amphibians and reptiles
    are different from those of birds and mammals and are more difficult to satisfy
    in captivity. As endotherms, birds and mammals have continuously high rates of
    metabolic heat production, and thermoregulation consists primarily of adjusting
    the insulating value of hair or feathers to equalize the rates of heat
    production and loss. Endotherms accomplish this regulation over a broad range of
    air temperatures. The radiative environments of the animal room and their cages
    normally have little significance.</p>
    <p>In contrast, amphibians and reptiles balance heat uptake from the environment
      (Tracy, 1976, 1982) with heat loss to the environment. Control of the radiant
      environment of the cage (in both the infrared and visible wavelengths) is
      especially important, because this is usually the major pathway of heat gain and
      loss. The thermoregulatory behaviors of many species, especially reptiles, are
      based on adjusting position, posture, and reflectivity in response to radiant
      flux. These animals may be unable to respond appropriately to a uniform
      temperature or to a substrate temperature gradient. Lizards can be confused by
      unnatural combinations of temperature and light intensity. For example, lizards
      controlled their body temperatures more effectively in gradients that provided
      the normal stimulus of bright light and heat at the same end of the gradient
      than they did in gradients that were uniformly lighted or those that combined
      bright light with low temperatures (Sievert and Hutchison, 1991). Photothermal
      gradients employing incandescent bulbs that produce both heat and light are
      probably the best choice for long-term care (Regal, 1980). These gradients must
      provide cool retreat sites as well as warm basking spots for the animals.
      Because the body temperatures that many species of lizards maintain during
      activity are only a few degrees below their lethal temperatures, overheating is
      a substantial risk if gradients are poorly designed. The cage must be large
      enough so that one end always remains cool, and cages that incorporate
      photothermal gradients should never be covered with solid lids that prevent the
      escape of heat. Shelters should be placed along the length of the gradient so
      that animals are not forced to choose between thermoregulation and security. In
      most cases, a variable temperature regime is necessary (Regal, 1967, 1971).
      Animals kept continuously at the warm body temperatures they select voluntarily
      during activity may show deleterious physiological changes (Licht, 1965).
      Transient exposure to high temperatures may suppress the immune system of
      reptiles (Elliott Jacobson, personal communication).</p>
    <p>Choosing the range of temperatures that should be provided for a particular
      species requires information about its phylogenetic affinities and ecology. The
      thermoregulatory characteristics of groups of reptiles have been summarized
      (Avery, 1982). In particular, Ford (in press) suggests appropriate temperatures
      for snakes. In general, amphibians are less heliothermic than reptiles, and the
      high rate of evaporative water loss characteristic of amphibian skin counteracts
      radiant heat uptake (Lillywhite, 1975; Tracy, 1976). Nonetheless, adult and
      larval amphibians bask in the sun or use temperature gradients to regulate body
      temperatures. A thermophilic response after feeding and behavioral fever
      mediated by prostaglandin A1 have been reported for amphibians (Lillywhite
      et al., 1973; Hutchison and Erskine, 1981). Substrate temperature gradients
      produced by heating elements beneath the cage floor may be more effective than
      photothermal gradients, especially for nocturnal or secretive amphibians. The
      thermoregulatory characteristics of amphibians have been summarized (Brattstrom,
      1979; Hutchison, in press), and information about salamanders can be found in
      Feder et al. (1982) and the references therein.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Water.
    </b> A shallow container of water is appropriate for many amphibians
    and reptiles. However, some tropical species require daily spraying, and some
    desert reptiles never drink. Amphibians do not drink; terrestrial species absorb
    water through the skin and anurans have an area of skin in the pelvic region
    that is specialized for this function. Shallow water dishes, moist substrates,
    and spraying are appropriate for terrestrial amphibians. Chlorinated water
    should be avoided, especially for aquatic amphibians, and water bowls should be
    changed as often as practical because <u>Pseudomonas</u> populations increase
    rapidly in stagnant water (Elliott Jacobson, personal communication).</p>
    <b>
      <p>Humidity and Air Flow.
    </b> Most amphibians and reptiles are much smaller than
    laboratory mice (Pough, 1980, 1983). An adult white mouse weighs about 20 g,
    while nearly 80 percent of the species of lizards and frogs and 95 percent of
    the salamanders have adult body masses smaller than 20 g (Figure 2). Indeed, 8
    percent of lizards, 17 percent of frogs, and 20 percent of salamanders weigh
    less than 1 g as adults! These very small body sizes have important implications
    for husbandry (Pough, in press). In their natural environments, most amphibians
    and reptiles spend their time at the ground surface, under leaf litter, or in
    burrows. As a result they are exposed to microclimates (especially humidities
    and rates of air movement) that are very different from those perceived by large
    animals like humans. Even desert species spend much of their time in burrows or
    buried in loose sand. Relative humidity approaches saturation in these
    microhabitats, and the low humidities characteristic of heated and
    air-conditioned buildings can be stressful even for desert reptiles. Relative
    humidities should be maintained above 70 percent (preferably at 80 percent) for
    nearly all species of amphibians and reptiles. However, most reptiles develop
    skin lesions when they are kept on wet substrates for long periods.</p>
    <p>Amphibians can often be kept in cages with lids to keep humidity high, but
      many reptiles require photothermal gradients. Putting a lid over a photothermal
      gradient quickly leads to lethal overheating of the animals inside. Instead, it
      is necessary to maintain high relative humidity in the entire animal room. Room
      air flow can be limited to a maximum of one or two changes per hour to maintain
      the humidities these animals require.</p>
    <p>The large number of incandescent lights required in a room that houses 20 or
      30 cages of lizards or snakes may produce more heat than the air-handling system
      can exhaust, especially when the number of air changes per hour is restricted to
      keep the relative humidity high. It is wise to incorporate thermostats to turn
      off the lights when room temperature approaches a level that is stressful for
      the least heat-tolerant species.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Light.
    </b> Quality and quantity of light may both be important to amphibians
    and reptiles. An annual cycle of day length is usually critical, especially for
    breeding colonies. Windows or skylights that admit bright sunlight without
    overheating the room are ideal, but are rarely included in animal rooms. In lieu
    of natural daylight cycles, timers can be used to control photoperiod on an
    annual cycle.</p>
    <p>The wavelengths of light provided to captive amphibians and reptiles also
      require attention, but little is known about the effects of different light
      intensities and of varying ratios of wavelengths. A trial-and-error approach has
      been adopted by zoos and individuals who maintain these animals, however this
      body of anecdote constitutes nearly all the information currently available.</p>
    <p>Providing the proper amount and quality of ultraviolet light is probably the
      most difficult aspect of lighting. Some species of amphibians and reptiles
      appear to require ultraviolet light for calcium metabolism, normal behavior, and
      reproduction (Cole and Townsend, 1977; Laszlo, 1969; Moehn, 1974; Townsend,
      1979; Townsend and Cole, 1985; Regal, 1980). Middle-wavelength ultraviolet light
      (UVB) penetrates the epidermis and converts provitamin D3 to previtamin D3.
      Synthesis of the active form of the vitamin (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) by birds
      and mammals has been studied, but the process is not well understood for
      amphibians and reptiles, some of which have as many as six types of provitamin
      D3 in their skins (Holick, 1989a).</p>
    <p>Some diurnal reptiles from open habitats have layers of melanin in the skin
      that block penetration of ultraviolet light (Porter, 1967). These animals might
      require higher intensities of light than do species with more translucent skins.
      Preliminary information from work at the National Zoo suggests that green
      iguanas (<u>Iguana</u> <u>iguana</u>) cannot use dietary vitamin D3, and must
      receive ultraviolet light for maintenance of blood levels of
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Mary Allen, personal communication). Similarly, birds
      and mammals synthesize two types of vitamin D3, and dietary
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 would not substitute for cutaneous synthesis of
      24-dehydrovitamin D3 (Holick, 1989b). However, several species of lizards have
      been raised successfully without ultraviolet light, in some cases for two or
      more generations, using dietary supplementation to provide vitamin D

    (Larry Talent, personal communication; Gehrmann et al., 1991).</p>
    <p>We do not know exactly what wavelengths of light are required for vitamin D3
      synthesis by amphibians and reptiles, nor do we know whether the ratio of
      middle-wavelength (290 to 315 nm) to long-wavelength (315 to 400 nm) ultraviolet
      light (UVA) is important. Gehrmann (1987) presented information about the
      spectra of several bulbs used in animal husbandry. Broad-spectrum fluorescent
      bulbs such as Vita-Lite' (Duro-test) and Chroma 50' (General Electric) may be
      effective (Regal, 1980), although these lights, especially the Chroma 50 bulb,
      emit little energy in the middle-wavelength ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.
      (Note that, contrary to common misconception among hobbyists, Gro-Lux' bulbs do
      not emit much ultraviolet light, and they are not appropriate for UV
      supplementation, although they may be used in displays to support plant growth
      without harm to animals) (Roberts and Gehrmann, 1990). Fluorescent BL (black
      light) bulbs provide long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA). Bulbs designated
      BLB (blacklight blue) have a filter that passes only ultraviolet wavelengths;
      they are more expensive than BL bulbs, but no more effective for animal
      husbandry. Neither a twelve-hour daily exposure to Vita-Lite' nor a half-hour
      exposure to a Sylvania BL bulb was sufficient for normal calcification of young
      chickens (Bernard et al., 1989), and the authors recommended that these bulbs
      not be used for captive animals.</p>
    <p>Middle-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVB) is provided by fluorescent sunlamp
      bulbs of the sort sometimes used in treating psoriasis. In addition to the
      familiar tubular fluorescent sunlamps, self-ballasted reflector mushroom-type
      mercury lamps emit UVA and UVB radiation (William H. Gehrmann, personal
      communication). They are manufactured in 160 and 250 watt sizes by Philips
      Lighting Co. and Iwaski Electric Co. National Biological Corporation (1532
      Enterprise Parkway, Twinsburg, OH 44087) is a source of UVA and UVB bulbs.
      Middle-wavelength ultraviolet light can injure the eyes of animals and
      caretakers, and precautions should be taken to limit exposure. Species of
      reptiles differ substantially in the UV exposure they require (Townsend and
      Cole, 1985; Gehrmann, 1987), and a conservative approach is advised. Exposure
      periods of 30-45 minutes at a distance of 50 cm from a UVB lamp may be
      satisfactory for reptiles from open habitats (Moyle, 1989). UV irradiance at the
      midpoint of tubular bulbs is about twice as intense as irradiance at the ends (Gerhmann,
      1987). Breaking the daily UVB exposure into 10-15 minute periods at hourly
      intervals may help to ensure that all the individuals in a community cage have
      access to the light.</p>
    <p>Snakes may normally satisfy their vitamin D3 requirements from their diet of
      whole animals (Ford, in press). Reptiles from forests, and amphibians in
      general, are probably more sensitive to UV light than are desert reptiles, and
      UVB bulbs are probably not appropriate for these animals. Early signs of UVB
      toxicity include failure to eat, lethargy, diminished activity, and a gray or
      smokey skin color that turns progressively darker (William Gerhmann, personal
      communication). All of these symptoms appear to be reversible when exposure
      ceases. Considering the potential risk posed by UVB bulbs to reptiles and their
      caretakers, a combination of broad-spectrum fluorescent bulbs and
      long-wavelength (UVA) bulbs is probably the most practical starting point for
      husbandry of a species with unknown requirements (Townsend and Cole, 1985). The
      bulbs should be as close as possible to the tops of the cages, preferably within
      15-20 cm of the animals. However, if symptoms of vitamin D3 deficiency are
      observed, it may be wise to consider providing a source of UVB radiation.</p>
    <p>Because glass does not transmit middle-wavelength ultraviolet light and
      greatly attenuates longer wavelengths, it should not be used for cage tops. Wire
      mesh and some acrylic plastics and fluoroplastics transmit short-wavelength
      ultraviolet light and are suitable for cage tops (Gehrmann, 1987).</p>
    <p>The ultraviolet output of fluorescent bulbs decreases substantially after a
      few hundred to a few thousand hours of use. Unfortunately, this change is not
      apparent to the human eye, and can be easily overlooked until the animals'
      health is affected. Manufacturers can provide information about the useful life
      of their bulbs, and a regular schedule of changing bulbs will ensure that the
      animals are receiving ultraviolet light (Townsend and Cole, 1985).</p>
    <b>
      <p><A name="Biological">The Biological</A> Environment</p>
    </b>
    <p>Most amphibians and reptiles are secretive. They live in close association
      with their structural microenvironments, and subtle cues--scent, texture,
      contact--are important aspects of their behavior. Animals of this sort do not
      thrive in barren steel cages or in plastic boxes filled with wood shavings;
      their husbandry requires housing that combines the animals' need for
      environmental cues with effective care and sanitation. Providing hiding places
      is of paramount importance for nearly all species.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Cage Furnishings.
    </b> Cage and aquarium props (e.g., branches, rocks, and
    substrate) should complement the normal lifestyle of the animal. A varied cage
    environment may be necessary for normal behavior; for example, the
    thermoregulatory and foraging behaviors of <u>Lacerta vivipara</u> break down in
    the absence of spatial diversity (Roger A. Avery, personal communication). Many
    species of amphibians and reptiles require materials that duplicate their
    natural settings for breeding. Terrestrial frogs such as <u>Eleutherodactylus</u>,<i>
    </i><u>Dendrobates</u>, and <u>Colostethus</u> breed in captivity when they are
    given suitable nest sites. In nature these species deposit their eggs in
    smooth-surfaced fallen leaves, which should be included in the cage. Nearly all
    animals require a hiding place; opaque plastic boxes with small entrance holes
    make good retreat sites, and have the merit of being easily cleaned. Thigmotaxic
    stimuli may be nearly as important as the darkness that opaque shelters provide.
    Cobras used transparent plastic boxes as regularly as they used opaque boxes for
    hiding places when the two kinds were tested sequentially. However, in
    simultaneous presentations, the snakes always chose the opaque box (Chiszar et
    al., 1987). It can be advantageous to be able to see an animal when it is in its
    retreat, and some situations may warrant the use of transparent shelters.</p>
    <p>Amphibians and reptiles often ingest bedding material with food, and cage
      substrates should be chosen with this possibility in mind, and several
      substrates commonly used for bird and mammal cages are harmful for amphibians
      and reptiles. Appropriate substrates keep the animal dry, such as newspaper,
      indoor-outdoor carpet, sand (only for species that normally live in sand),
      gravel (smooth particles that are fine enough to pass through the digestive
      tract), crushed oyster shell (especially good for tortoises and large lizards
      and snakes), hardwood mulch and bark chips, and peat and sphagnum moss.
      Materials that swell when they are swallowed, such as ground corn cobs, kitty
      litter, the pine shavings used in rodent cages, and cocoa shells, should not be
      used (Demeter, 1989). Cedar shavings have neurotoxic properties and should not
      be used (Elliott Jacobson, personal communication). Aspen shavings (Animal
      Bedding #2, American Excelsior Co., Arlington, TX) have proven satisfactory for
      snakes (Ford, in press).</p>
    <p>Many animals press their snouts against the walls of their cage as they
      explore, and rough or sharp surfaces may injure them.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Behavioral Interactions.
    </b> Many amphibians and reptiles are territorial in
    the field, and in captivity often form dominance hierarchies. Initially the
    establishment of these dominant-subordinate relationships is likely to involve
    fighting and the risk of injury, especially because the loser is unable to leave
    the cage. After hierarchies have stabilized, low-ranking individuals may be
    excluded from feeding, basking, or retreat sites (Regal, 1971). Aggressive
    behavior often waxes and wanes seasonally. For example, courtship can lead to
    injury of a female that rejects a male's advances but is unable to escape from
    him. Caretakers must be alert to subtle departures from normal behavior that
    indicate incipient problems, as well as to the appearance of wounds and new
    scars.</p>
    <p>Caretakers must also be aware of the sensory worlds of the animals and the
      stimuli that are important to them. For example, it is stressful for a
      plethodontid salamander to be moved into a cage that bears the scent of another
      individual, or to have pheromones from another salamander deposited on its body
      during handling (Jaeger, in press). Ovarian development of female lizards (<u>Anolis
        carolinensis</u>) has been reported to be accelerated by the sight of male
      lizards giving courtship displays, and retarded by watching aggressive
      interactions between males (Crews, 1975).</p>
    <p>Social interactions may be important components of the biology of some
      amphibians and reptiles. Crocodilians appear to be the most social reptiles, and
      parental care for young after hatching is probably universal among crocodilians
      (Lang, 1987). Sibling groups of young crocodilians remain with one or both
      parents for extended periods--as long as 24 months for the American alligator (Garrick
      and Lang, 1977; Hutton, 1989). Young American alligators spend the day together,
      basking on land or moving back and forth between land and water. At night the
      individuals disperse to forage, reassembling in the morning (Deitz, 1979 (quoted
      in Lang, 1987)). Vocalizations by juveniles and adults assist in maintaining
      these groups, and a distress call from a juvenile brings an adult to the rescue.
      Juvenile and adult crocodilians may continue to associate in social groups,
      sometimes segregated by age and sex. These social interactions have implications
      for management (Lang, 1987), and the behavioral consequences of raising and
      maintaining crocodilians in isolation have not been studied. The possibility
      that behavioral imprinting of juveniles occurs during their association with
      their parents should be considered in husbandry programs.</p>
    <p>Some lizards and snakes employ communal defecation, hiding, or egg-laying
      sites. Several lizards and a few snakes remain with their eggs, and prolonged
      association between mother and offspring has been reported for the Solomon
      Islands prehensile-tailed skink, <u>Corucia zebrata</u> (John Groves, personal
      communication). Parental care by some species of frogs extends to association
      between an adult and its tadpoles or hatchlings (see Duellman and Trueb (1986)
      for examples). I suspect that social interactions are more widespread among
      amphibians and reptiles than we currently realize, and in some cases may
      components of successful husbandry.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Food.
    </b> The type of food and the rate of feeding should, at a minimum,
    ensure normal growth or maintenance of weight. (The nutritional requirements of
    breeding animals may be different from those only being maintained.) The low
    metabolic rates and high conversion efficiencies of ectotherms means that
    overfeeding of captive animals is more common than underfeeding. The food
    requirements of amphibians and reptiles vary widely; some species require nearly
    daily feeding, whereas others do best on three, two, or even one feeding per
    week. Very large snakes may benefit from still longer intervals between meals.
    In general, if a healthy animal that has adjusted to captivity does not accept
    food soon after it is offered, the food should be removed and the animal allowed
    to fast until the next feeding time. In salamanders, crocodilians, snakes, and
    lizards emaciation is first visible as concavity at the base of the tail and
    prominence of the lateral processes of the caudal vertebrae. The pelvic girdle
    of emaciated frogs is clearly outlined. While turtles exhibit fewer conspicuous
    signs of emaciation, with experience it becomes easy to recognize a turtle that
    feels too light for its size.</p>
    <p>The foods that can be provided to amphibians and reptiles in captivity rarely
      resemble their natural diets, and the nutritional requirements of amphibians and
      reptiles are poorly understood. A varied diet is likely to be more nutritious
      and more readily accepted than a diet consisting of only one kind of food.
      Providing balanced nutrition for amphibians and reptiles is challenging, and a
      variety of opinions can be found in the literature. The following paragraphs
      emphasize points of agreement, but the references should be consulted for
      additional information and dissenting views.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Vitamins and Minerals.
    </b> The routine use of supplementary vitamins and
    calcium is often advised for amphibians and reptiles (Campbell and Busack, 1979;
    Allen et al., 1986; de Vosjoli, 1990a; Staton et al., 1990), but generalizations
    about the quantities needed are difficult to formulate. Studies of lizards have
    revealed substantial interspecific and geographic variation in vitamin and
    mineral requirements, and the symptoms of vitamin deficiency or excess are
    similarly variable (Larry Talent, personal communication). Many multivitamin
    supplements don't state nutrient levels on their labels. Using a product without
    knowing whether it has, for example, 5000 or 50,000 IU of vitamin A per gram is
    dangerous (Mary Allen, personal communication).</p>
    <p>As with UVB supplementation, we remain largely at a trial-and-error stage,
      and a conservative approach to vitamin supplementation is probably the best
      starting point for a species with unknown requirements. Selective
      supplementation of particular nutrients is preferable to a shotgun approach. For
      example, a calcium:phosphorus ratio of 1.5:1 promotes normal bone growth.</p>
    <p>Food items can be dusted with a vitamin-mineral mixture just before they are
      offered to the animals; uneaten items should be removed from the cage. Most
      insects have low levels of calcium, and dusting them with a calcium/phosoporous
      mixture that adjusts the ratio is desirable. D-Ca-Fos' (Fort Dodge Labs, Fort
      Dodge, IA 50501) is a finely powdered mixture of vitamin D, calcium and
      phosphorus that can be applied to insects as small as fruit flies and pinhead
      crickets. Beta-carotene and vitamins C and E may also be beneficial, but
      excessive vitamin and mineral supplementation can cause problems (de Vosjoli
      1990). Feeding a balanced diet is preferable to supplementing an inadequate one.</p>
    <p>The diets of anurans can be supplemented by putting slow-moving insects, such
      as mealworms and wax moth larvae in shallow dishes with powdered vitamins and
      minerals. When the frogs catch the insects, some of the powder adheres to their
      tongues and is ingested with the prey. Many lizards will eat a mixture of dry
      vitamin and mineral powders and fine silica sand from a dish (Larry Talent,
      personal communication).</p>
    <b>
      <p>Live Food.
    </b> Many amphibians and reptiles respond to movement and will
    ignore even their favorite prey if it is motionless. Live food is required for
    these animals, and husbandry of amphibians and reptiles often requires
    maintaining colonies of insects as well.</p>
    <p><u>Insects</u>. Diets that alternate different kinds of live food are
      desirable, and a diet consisting solely of mealworms is notoriously
      unsatisfactory (e.g., Demeter, 1989). A combination of crickets (<u>Acheta</u>),
      mealworms (<u>Tenebrio</u> larvae), flour beetle larvae (<u>Tribolium</u>) and
      wax moth (<u>Galleria</u>) or fly larvae (<u>Sarcophaga</u>) is suitable for
      insectivorous lizards and amphibians. Roaches (<u>Blaberus</u>), king mealworms
      (<u>Zoophobias</u>), and fruit flies (<u>Drosophila</u>) are also standard food
      items for captive amphibians and reptiles. The insects must be healthy and
      well-fed if they are to be nutritious food. Insects that are not eaten promptly
      should be removed from cages, because they may attack the animals. Suggested
      diets and instructions for care of insects and other invertebrates are available
      in <u>The Encyclopedia of Live Foods</u> (Masters, 1975), the <u>Carolina
        Arthropods Manual</u> (Anonymous, 1982), and <u>The Right Way to Feed
        Insect-eating Lizards</u> (de Vosjoli, 1990). Mary Allen (National Zoo)
      recommends monkey chow and dog kibble as a stock cricket diet.</p>
    <p>The material in the gut of insects is an important source of nutrients for
      amphibians and reptiles, and insects can be nutrient-loaded to increase their
      food value. A high-calcium diet for crickets (Cricket diet #39-390) is available
      from Ziegler Bros., Inc. (PO Box 95, Gardners, PA 17325). This diet is intended
      for calcium-loading crickets before they are fed to amphibians and reptiles; it
      is not suitable for rearing crickets. The gastrointestinal tracts of crickets
      contained detectable quantities of calcium and phosphorus after 48 hours on the
      high-calcium diet (see Allen and Oftedahl, 1989 for details and suggestions).</p>
    <p><u>Birds and Mammals</u>. Mice, rats, and hatchling chickens or quail should
      be euthanized by an approved method that does not leave a toxic chemical residue
      before they are fed to captive amphibians and reptiles. Asphyxiation with carbon
      dioxide or nitrogen is a satisfactory method of killing animals for this
      purpose.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Prepared Diets.
    </b> Although many amphibians and reptiles have narrow dietary
    preferences, some species can be trained to accept prepared foods that
    incorporate vitamin and mineral supplements. Good candidates for such dietary
    shifts are lizards and snakes that rely on scent to identify food. Skinks (<u>Eumeces</u>,
    <u>Chalcides</u>, and many other genera), tegus and dwarf tegus (<u>Tupinambis</u>
    and <u>Callopistes</u>), monitor lizards (<u>Varanus</u>), and natricine snakes
    (<u>Thamnophis</u>, <u>Nerodia,</u> and related genera) will often learn to
    accept canned cat and dog food. The odor of a fish-based food is sometimes
    particularly attractive, even to species that never see a fish in their natural
    state. Dietary shifts can be facilitated by introducing them gradually, a
    time-honored technique among reptile keepers (Weldon, in press). For example, a
    lizard that eats mice can initially be given mice with progressively more cat
    food spread on the fur, then cat food in a dish garnished with portions of a
    mouse carcass, and finally plain cat food. Not all of the commercial foods for
    reptiles and amphibians that are sold in pet stores provide a well-balanced
    diet, and advice about specific products should be sought from a qualified
    source. Many of the major zoos now have nutritionists who can provide helpful
    information.</p>
    <b>
      <p>Herbivorous Reptiles.
    </b> Many species of reptiles include some plant
    material in their diets. The most specialized of these are folivores
    (leaf-eaters). Prominent in this group are large lizards (e.g., chuckwallas (<u>Sauromalus</u>),
    green iguanas (<u>Iguana</u>), ground iguanas (<u>Cyclura</u>), the Galapagos
    marine and land iguanas (<u>Amblyrhynchus</u> and <u>Conolophus</u>), Fijian
    iguanas (<u>Brachylophus</u>), mastigures (<u>Uromastyx</u>), the East Indian
    water lizard (<u>Hydrosaurus</u>), and the green sea turtle <u>(Chelonia mydas)</u>.
    These species rely on fermentative digestion and show characteristic
    morphological and physiological specializations of the gut (Iverson, 1982; McBee
    and McBee, 1982; Troyer, 1983, 1984a; Bjorndal, 1985; Bjorndal and Bolten,
    1990). Food particle size, the ratio of fruit to foliage, and the ratio of plant
    to animal material can affect digestibility and the assimilation of energy and
    nutrients by herbivorous reptiles (Bjorndal, 1989, 1991; Bjorndal et al. 1990).</p>
    <p>Nutritionally complete diets for herbivorous reptiles are commercially
      available. Ziegler Bros., Inc. (PO Box 95, Gardners, PA 17325) makes 15% and 25%
      crude protein meal-type diets for iguanas, and a variation of that diet in small
      pellets for desert tortoises. Marion Zoological (Marion, KS) makes an extruded
      diet of very small diameter for herbivorous reptiles. A mixture of 10 parts by
      weight of leafy greens to one part soaked dry dog food is a good alternative.
      The dog food should be soaked just enough to soften it because excess water can
      leach out nutrients (Mary Allen, personal communication). Chopped alfalfa hay is
      also accepted by tortoises, especially when it is mixed with greens.</p>
    <p>The specializations of folivorous reptiles extend beyond morphology and
      physiology to include behavior and ecology, and these phenomena must be
      considered in husbandry. Like all folivores, reptiles are selective about the
      species and the parts of plants they eat. Juvenile iguanas choose leaves with
      low fiber and high protein content, and they accelerate digestion by maintaining
      body temperatures higher than those of adults (Troyer, 1984b, 1987). Social
      behavior probably also contributes to folivory for iguanas: newly hatched green
      iguanas spend a short time in the tropical forest canopy where adult iguanas
      live before returning to the forest-edge vegetation where they remain during
      their growth as juveniles. Apparently this brief association of hatchlings with
      adults facilitates the transfer of the gut symbionts responsible for
      fermentative digestion of plant matter (Troyer, 1982, 1984c). Thus, juvenile
      folivores hatched in captivity and isolated from sources of normal symbionts
      probably do not have their species' typical complement of fermentative
      microorganisms. Although these individuals may grow and prosper on diets that do
      not require fermentation of plant cell walls, their digestive physiology is
      probably not typical of free-ranging individuals. This observation has important
      implications for laboratory studies that assume their subjects to be in a normal
      physiological state, and for husbandry programs that rear juveniles for release.
      In situations when digestive physiology is important, husbandry of folivorous
      reptiles should probably include a method of inoculating hatchlings with the
      species' typical gut symbionts. This may be a matter of substantial applied
      significance, because many folivorous species of reptiles are threatened or
      endangered, and captive breeding programs for some of them are planned or in
      progress (Bjorndal, 1981; Burghardt and Rand, 1982; Miller, 1987; IUCN, 1989;
      Swingland and Klemens, 1989).</p>
    <b>
      <p>Housing and Sanitation.
    </b>Housing conditions should inhibit the presence
    and spread of disease. However, sanitation protocols should not frequently
    disturb the animals nor require complete removal of feces because many
    ectothermal vertebrates use pheromones, including constituents of feces, for
    intraspecific communication. Snakes kept in clean cages spend more time
    attempting to escape than do individuals in cages where a small amount of fecal
    matter is left each time the cage is cleaned (Chiszar et al., 1980). Similarly,
    plethodontid salamanders mark their cages with pheromones in their feces, and
    salamanders in freshly cleaned cages make more attempts to escape than do
    salamanders in cages they have marked with their own scent (Jaeger, 1986 and
    references therein). Thus, excessive cleaning or sterilization of cages can be
    deleterious to the well-being of the animals. The human nose is the most
    appropriate guide to cleanliness: No odor of waste products should be
    perceptible in the air of a room housing ectothermal animals. Application of
    this criterion is practical and effective because unsanitary conditions are
    readily detected when the number of changes of room air per hour is limited to
    maintain the high relative humidities amphibians and reptiles require.</p>
    <p>Through-flow aquatic systems are less likely to spread pathogens than are
      recirculating systems. Chlorine should be removed from incoming water, which
      should be heated or cooled to the appropriate temperature before it is
      introduced to the animals' tanks. If a recirculating water system is necessary,
      each tank should have a self-contained system to minimize the chances of
      cross-contamination. A sterilization process may be a desirable component of
      recirculating aquatic systems.</p>
    <p>Separate quarantine facilities are highly desirable for amphibians and
      reptiles, and newly arrived animals should be kept in cages isolated from
      long-term stock for at least 90 days (Elliott Jacobson, personal communication).
      Checks for parasites should be routine. These tests contribute to the health of
      the caretakers as well as to the welfare of the animals.</p>
    <p><A name="marking">MARKING</A> INDIVIDUALS</p>
    <p>The ability to recognize individuals is critical to many studies, and methods
      of marking amphibians and reptiles were reviewed by Ferner (1979). In many
      instances individual variations in pattern allow even large numbers of animals
      to be distinguished without artificial marks. When this is not possible, several
      techniques can be employed, depending on whether long-term or short-term marks
      are needed. Clipping off portions of toes or scales has traditionally been used
      to mark individuals, but toe clipping in particular is painful and may affect
      locomotor ability, especially for arboreal species. Furthermore, some
      individuals regenerate the clipped toes or lose additional toes in fights.
      Freeze-branding appears to produce a mark that lasts one or two seasons. Passive
      integrated transponders (PIT tags) have been used successfully to mark
      amphibians and reptiles, and this appears to be the best method of permanently
      marking species that are large enough to accommodate the tag (Camper and Dixon,
      1988).</p>
    <p><A name="Breeding">BREEDING</A></p>
    <p>The reproductive cycles of amphibians and reptiles are closely linked to
      their physical and biological environments, and effective breeding programs
      employ manipulation of these factors (e.g, Crews and Garrick, 1980).
      Case-studies are published in the newsletters and symposia of herpetological
      societies, the International Zoo Yearbook, and hobbyist literature. As with most
      other aspects of herpetological husbandry, we are at the stage of trial and
      error, and investigators should seek information about the species of interest
      to them from those publications and from the staffs of zoos and aquaria, many of
      which have successful breeding programs for several species. Some
      generalizations will provide a starting point, for example, manipulating
      temperature, humidity, and photoperiod on an annual cycle has been effective for
      many species. A period of one to four months of low temperature stimulates
      breeding for a variety of reptiles and amphibians, including some tropical
      species. This method has been applied successfully to snakes (e.g., Scheidt,
      1984; Tryon and Whitehead, 1988), as well as to lizards, turtles, and
      amphibians. Animals must be allowed to fast before they are cooled, and a
      gradual reduction in temperature over a period of days is preferable to an
      abrupt change. Environmental temperatures can be lowered to 10
  </font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C
    for species from the temperate zone, whereas warmer temperatures (18</font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C-20</font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C)
    are appropriate for tropical species. Most animals do not become torpid under
    these conditions, but emerge from their hiding places during the day and retreat
    at night. A short photoperiod is more natural than continuous darkness, and a
    daily temperature cycle may be desirable. Dehydration is a risk in environmental
    chambers that regulate temperature by passing air over refrigerating coils. The
    cages must prevent excessive water loss without allowing the continuous contact
    with wet substrates which is likely to produce skin lesions. As the end of the
    cool period approaches, the photoperiod should be lengthened and the temperature
    gradually increased. Animals undergoing this treatment are not in any sense in
    cold storage or suspended animation, and water dishes should be cleaned and
    refilled daily.</p>
    <p>Seasons in some habitats, particularly in the tropics, are distinguished more
      clearly by rainfall patterns than by temperature cycles. Animals from these
      habitats may be induced to breed by simulated rain showers. This method was used
      by the Metropolitan Toronto Zoo to breed Puerto Rican crested toads (<u>Peltophryne
        lemur</u>) (Paine et al., 1989). The breeding schedule is keyed to environmental
      conditions in the toads' natural habitat. In December, which corresponds to
      the late part of the rainy season in Puerto Rico, feeding is increased, and
      females receive newborn mice dusted with vitamin D
  </font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="2">3</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">
    and calcium supplements. In late January, when the dry season is beginning, the
    toads are put into a cage that has been filled with a water-soaked mixture of
    peat and sphagnum mosses. Ambient temperature is about 22</font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C,
    and the relative humidity is 50 to 70 percent. The toads burrow into the
    substrate, which dries slowly during the next month; a shallow water dish in the
    cage allows the toads to rehydrate when they emerge from the substrate at night.
    The toads are dug out of the moss and fed weekly, until feeding ceases at about
    the time the moss dries completely. The toads are kept for another month in the
    dry substrate, and checked regularly to see that they remain hydrated.</p>
    <p>At the end of 60 days of dryness, a time that corresponds to the usual onset
      of the Puerto Rican rainy season, water is added gradually for two days until
      the moss is saturated with water, and the air temperature is raised to 27
  </font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C.
    On the morning of the third day, the males are transferred to tanks of water in
    which cultures of algae have been established. A spray of water simulates
    rainfall, and tape recorded mating calls of the toads are played to both sexes.
    The males are left in the breeding tanks for two days before the females are
    added. The presence of a group of toads appears to contribute to the formation
    of amplexing pairs, and amplexus normally begins very soon after the females are
    introduced. The simulated rainfall and recordings of mating calls are continued
    for another three or four days.</p>
    <p>The Toronto Zoo's program illustrates the effectiveness of techniques that
      initiate the physiological changes associated with breeding by manipulating the
      physical and biological conditions that stimulate breeding in nature. Another
      approach is to administer exogenous hormones to initiate reproduction. This
      method has been widely used by embryologists to induce breeding by amphibians
      (e.g., Rugh, 1962; National Academy of Sciences, 1974), and the process is so
      simple that amphibian reproduction kits can be purchased from biological supply
      houses. Pituitary glands from amphibians or human chorionic gonadotropin have
      traditionally been employed for this purpose, but Goncharov et al. (1989)
      advocated the use of synthetic analogues of luteinizing hormone-releasing
      hormone. Caution in the use of these techniques may be desirable, because larvae
      produced by administration of exogenous hormones might differ in morphology,
      growth rate, behavior, or viability from those obtained from breedings that
      result from endogenous endocrine cycles. An extensive literature of life-history
      studies testifies to the importance of maternal effects that are controlled by
      environmental variables such as temperature and energy intake during
      vitellogenesis (e.g., Kaplan, 1987). These interactions might be affected by
      interruption of normal reproductive cycles, and if exogenous hormones are to be
      employed, their use should be coordinated with the breeding cycle so that
      hormones are administered after gametes have matured (Goncharov et al., 1989)</p>
    <p>The nutritional status of a female reptile during oogenesis or pregnancy and
      the environment in which eggs are reared can affect characters of the clutch and
      of the offspring. In laboratory studies of viviparous and oviparous snakes the
      ratio of clutch mass (eggs or embryos) to female body mass remained constant
      under different feeding regimes, with the result that absolute reproductive
      effort (grams of offspring per female) was proportional to energy intake (Ford
      and Siegel, 1989; 1991). That is, females that were well fed during oogenesis
      produced larger litters than did females that received less food. In these
      experiments, only the number of offspring responded to maternal nutritional
      status, but in some species of reptiles the size and viability of the offspring
      might be affected. Viviparity has evolved at least 45 times among lizards, and
      another 35 times among snakes (Blackburn, 1982, 1985). Modes of fetal nutrition
      among viviparous reptiles encompass a spectrum from lecithotrophy (nutrients
      deposited in the yolk during vitellogenesis) to matrotrophy (nutrients supplied
      throughout development via a placenta). The skink <u>Mabuya</u> <u>heathi</u>, a
      Brazilian lizard, exhibits a nearly mammalian level of matrotrophy (Blackburn et
      al., 1984). The newly ovulated egg is only 1 mm in diameter, and placental
      transport accounts for more than 99 percent of the dry mass of the fetus at
      birth. Another skink, <u>Chalcides chalcides</u>, a species that is used in
      biological studies, may also rely primarily on matrotrophy during embryonic
      development: the ova of <u>C</u>. <u>chalcides</u> are less than 3 mm in
      diameter at ovulation (Blackburn et al., 1984). For these skinks, and for other
      reptiles with high levels of maternal input to the fetus, the nutrition of a
      female during embryonic development may influence the size and viability of the
      young she produces.</p>
    <p>Temperature is an important factor in the embryonic development of reptiles.
      Normal morphogenesis is limited to a narrow range of egg temperatures for some
      species of reptiles, whereas others tolerate ranges as large as 10
  </font>
  <font FACE="Symbol">'</font>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua">C
    (Packard and Packard, 1988). Temperatures outside those ranges may be lethal to
    the embryos, or may produce hatchlings with abnormal skeletons, scale patterns,
    or pigmentation (Vinegar, 1973) as well as differences in post-hatching survival
    (Whitehead et al., 1990). Snakes hatched from eggs that had been incubated at
    intermediate temperatures performed better in several behavioral tests than
    hatchlings from higher and lower incubation temperatures (Burger, 1989, 1990),
    and alligators from eggs incubated at intermediate temperatures grew faster and
    survived better than those from higher or lower temperatures (Joanen et al.,
    1987). Temperature-dependent sex determination has been demonstrated for species
    in seven families of turtles, for crocodilians, and for a few lizards
    (summarized by Paukstis and Janzen, 1990).</p>
    <p>The wetness of the substrate on which reptile eggs are incubated affects the
      length of the incubation period and the size and robustness of the hatchlings
      (Packard and Packard, 1988). The same phenomenon has been demonstrated for one
      species of frog (Taigen et al., 1984). The largest and most vigorous turtle
      hatchlings are usually produced by incubating eggs in wet substrates (water
      potentials of -100 to -200 kPa) at the lowest tolerable temperatures (Gary C.
      Packard, personal communication). However, this advice must be modified for
      species that display temperature-dependent sex determination to avoid producing
      hatchlings of only one sex. As a rule of thumb, temperatures that produce
      incubation periods similar to those observed in the field are likely to be
      satisfactory (Miller, 1987). Unlike the eggs of birds, reptile eggs should not
      be turned during development.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><A name="Environmental">ENVIRONMENTAL</A> CONDITIONS AND MEDICAL CARE</p>
    <p>A discussion of the veterinary requirements of amphibians and reptiles is
      beyond the scope of this review, but the importance of environmental conditions,
      particularly temperature during illness and following surgery should be noted.
      The role of temperature in reptilian health management was reviewed by Mader
      (1985, 1991). Fishes, amphibians, and reptiles maintain elevated body
      temperatures when they are injected with pathogens, and this behavioral fever is
      associated with increased survival compared to animals that are prevented from
      raising their temperatures (Vaughn et al., 1974; Kluger, 1977, 1979). The immune
      response of reptiles is temperature-sensitive (Evans and Cowles, 1959; Evans,
      1963; Cohen, 1971; Elkan, 1976), and antibiotic therapy also may be most
      effective at high temperatures (Mader et al., 1985). Because behavioral fever is
      a normal response of reptiles and amphibians to endogenous pyrogens, it may be
      desirable to allow the animals to control their febrile response during
      antibiotic treatment and following surgery by keeping them in thermal gradients
      so they can warm themselves several degrees above their normal activity
      temperatures.</p>
    <p><A name="Release">HEALTH</A> PRECAUTIONS FOR RELEASE OF ANIMALS</p>
    <p>The release of amphibians and reptiles that have been held in captivity is
      potentially damaging to the health and the genetic composition of wild
      populations. It should be prohibited in almost all cases. Cross-contamination of
      animals with pathogens is nearly unavoidable in captivity, and amphibians and
      reptiles that are obtained from dealers have been exposed to a wide range of
      microorganisms that they would not encounter in their natural habitats. If these
      animals are released, the pathogens they carry can spread to the wild population
      with potentially disastrous results. From 1987 to 1990 an outbreak of upper
      respiratory distress syndrome (an infection by <u>Pasturella</u> <u>testudinis</u>
      and <u>Mycoplasma</u> spp) reduced the population of desert tortoises at the
      Desert Tortoise Natural Area in California from an estimated 1000 individuals 30
      survivors. The outbreak may be associated, at least in part, with the release of
      captive tortoises by well-meaning individuals (Elliott Jacobson, personal
      communication).</p>
    <p>Even in the absence of disease, the introduction of individuals from a
      distant part of a species' range can change the genetic composition of local
      populations, and exotic species may establish populations that compete with
      native species. A recent summary lists more than 20 exotic species of reptiles
      and amphibians that have become established in the United States (Conant and
      Collins, 1991).</p>
    <p>Under some circumstances the release of animals does not pose a risk, or the
      risk can be justified. If animals are rigorously isolated from any contact with
      other species while they are in captivity and are returned to their sites of
      capture, no harm is likely to result. Work with threatened or endangered species
      may require the release of animals after they have been in captivity. In this
      case, the animals should be kept isolated from other species, and from
      individuals of other populations of their own species, and they should be
      thoroughly screened for parasites and pathogens before they are released.
      Institutional animal care and use committees must be alert to the dangers
      associated with releasing animals. Committee members must expand their view of
      animal welfare to consider impacts on wild, as well as on captive populations.
      Unfortunately, the only possible option for animals that do not meet the
      criteria for release may be euthanasia.</p>
    <p><A name="Animal">HEALTH</A> PRECAUTIONS FOR ANIMAL CARETAKERS</p>
    <p>Most amphibians and reptiles pose no greater risks for caretakers than do
      birds and mammals. Normal precautions include washing the hands after working
      with the animals or their feces. A dust mask should be worn when cages
      containing dry fecal material are cleaned. <u>Salmonella</u> is frequently
      associated with reptiles, and its presence should be assumed unless several
      cultures of fresh feces have given negative results.</p>
    <p>Some amphibians have potent skin toxins, and a few species can be dangerous
      to humans (e.g., <u>Phyllobates terribilis</u>; see Myers et al., 1978).
      Venomous snakes are potentially dangerous to caretakers, as are the two species
      of venomous lizards (the gila monster and Mexican beaded lizard, <u>Heloderma</u>
      <u>suspectum</u> and <u>H. horridum</u>). Dangerously venomous snakes are not
      limited to vipers, elapids, and sea snakes; many colubrid snakes are venomous
      and some of these can be dangerously toxic to an animal as large as a human.
      Gans (1978, appendix 2) lists more than 40 species of venomous colubrids.
    </p>
    <p>Husbandry of dangerously venomous snakes is a specialized activity involving
      legal and ethical responsibilities that are beyond the scope of these general
      recommendations. Most research programs do not require venomous snakes, and they
      should not be kept in an academic institution without a compelling reason to do
      so. Gans and Taub (1978) discuss the precautions that are necessary for housing
      venomous snakes, as well as the daunting legal implications of keeping these
      potentially dangerous animals.</p>
    <p><A name="Summary">SUMMARY</A></p>
    <p>Successful husbandry of amphibians and reptiles must be based on an
      understanding of the ways in which they function as intact organisms. That is,
      one must know what physical and biological factors are important to them, how
      they interact with their environments, and how they exhibit signs of good or
      poor health. While the same principle applies to the care of a laboratory mouse,
      amphibians and reptiles are sufficiently different from mammals that our
      intuitive sense of what makes a suitable environment is not a satisfactory
      guide. Standards based on mammalian husbandry are likely to be detrimental to
      amphibians and reptiles. Intuition must be replaced by an understanding of the
      unique characteristics of ectothermal vertebrates and how these characteristics
      affect husbandry. Amphibians and reptiles are wild animals, and we must adapt
      our laboratory techniques to their needs; we cannot expect them to adjust their
      biology to suit our convenience.</p>
