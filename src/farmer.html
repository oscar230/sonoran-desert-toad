        <h1>Farmer Bob's Good Life</h1>
    </center>
    <p><i>by Ward Parkway</i>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rusty screen door slammed shut behind him, Farmer
        Bob could see his breath drifting away in the silent pre-dawn air. Beneath his
        well-worn Carhart coveralls he remained quite toasty though, from Mrs. Bob's
        hearty breakfast of eggs, sausage, and a big pile o' buttermilk biscuits
        smothered with thick sausage gravy. That and a steamin' pot of coffee, black as
        your old hat, steeled him against the frigid February morning. With old and
        callused hands, he pulled his Ralston Feed cap down snug and headed out through
        the back yard to the barnyard gate to break ice on the water tanks. Winter
        always meant extra chores, but he took it all in stride. For Farmer Bob, there
        just weren't no better life to be had.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky glowed a faint, dark magenta through the hedgerow
        to the east as he went quietly about his work. With a blunt and scarred axe, he
        quickly busted up the ice on the shallow ankle-high water tanks lined up against
        the feedlot fence. Then, picking up a small pitchfork, he tossed the frozen
        chunks out onto the dirty concrete, where they crashed and skidded away in all
        directions. With that finished, he strode around the corner of the white wooden
        barn and lifting the metal latch on the side door, opened it wide. The door
        opened onto a long hay-strewn hallway, on either side of which were the gates to
        knee-high pens constructed of metal tubing and closely-woven wire mesh. Above
        each pen hung an infrared lamp dangling waist-high from an electrical cord,
        altogether creating a segmented series of dim red glows down the length of the
        dusty and cobwebbed hallway. Going over the day's schedule in his head, Farmer
        Bob paused to stoop down, unlatch and pull open each gate behind him as he made
        his way down to the other end.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if on cue, the daily procession began. From each pen
        emerged half a dozen or so Colorado River Toads, of varying sizes. Hesitantly at
        first, as if still half asleep, they hopped out into the dimly lit hallway,
        pausing before turning and following Farmer Bob down to the feed trough at the
        far end of the barn. With the last of the thirty pens opened, there formed a
        surging river of toads streaming down to take up their places in the little
        stanchions arrayed along the long galvanized metal feed trough. As they were
        bellying up, Farmer Bob busied himself filling two five-gallon buckets with feed
        pellets from a small chute protruding out of a storage bin. Walking along the
        backside of the trough, he poured out the contents of the first bucket, stopping
        when it was empty to retrieve the second bucket and finish filling the remaining
        length. He walked back to peer up the hallway, making sure there were no
        stragglers. Seeing that all the toads were now enthusiastically enjoying their
        morning repast, he reached up and threw the first switch on a grimy control
        panel mounted on the wall behind him. A creaking mechanical noise accompanied
        the slow, gentle closing of the little stanchions around each toad, holding them
        firmly and comfortably in their places as they continued their unabashed
        munching.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmer Bob then retrieved a dusty remote control that lay
        atop the switch panel and pointing it across the feeding area at a small, black
        Sony mini stack, fingered the small rubber buttons to mount and play one of the
        five CDs he kept loaded in it. The dusty silence suddenly gave way to the
        haunting strains of &quot;Lizard Point&quot; from Eno's Ambient #4 - On Land. He
        didn't have the foggiest notion who this Eno feller was, as he'd found this
        particular CD layin' on the dashboard of his pickup after a visit from his
        nephew. The toads musta' known though, as they always responded well to it,
        producing copious amounts of fluid, now oozing out and visible like small,
        glistening pearls along their backs.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set the remote back down and threw the second switch on
        the panel, starting a steady electrical hum as a line of miniature milking
        machines descended on black rubber tubes from the ceiling above the trough. When
        the little metal suction units reached chest height, they stopped abruptly and
        the floor beneath the trough began to rise on hydraulic cylinders, bringing the
        toads up to a level where they could be handled comfortably without Farmer Bob's
        having to bend down.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting at one end and working quickly, he moved down the
        line of toads, first inspecting, then carefully attaching a suction unit to the
        back of each one. The toads seemed unmoved by this daily ritual, as they went
        about their meal. When the last toad was hooked up, he stepped back to the
        control panel and threw yet another switch, turning on the pump apparatus, which
        each toad acknowledged by raising its head momentarily from the trough.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, after the toads were sucked dry, he'd unhook 'em,
        lower the floor, release the stanchions and open the door to the barnyard, where
        the sun would be warming things up a bit. Farmer Bob weren't no factory farmer -
        these here were free-range toads, 'cept at night when they enjoyed their cozy,
        heated pens.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once set in motion, the milking process would take awhile,
        so Farmer Bob leaned back against the wall and reaching into his back pocket,
        pulled out a beat up-looking Motorola cell phone. Unfolding it, he punched in
        the number to the local collection depot and listened as it rang. After several
        rings, a voice on the other end answered. It was Dewey Purnell, the feller who
        drove the big stainless steel tank truck.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;You oughta stop by this morning, Dewey,&quot;</i>
        drawled Farmer Bob, <i>&quot;My tank's gettin' near full.&quot;</i>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;Sure thing, Bob,&quot;</i> answered Dewey. <i>&quot;We've
            got two other stops to make in your neck of the woods this mornin'. I'll be
            damned if both Ed Fletcher and Hob Carter didn't call to say they were ready for
            a tankin' as well. I oughta make it over to your place by eight o'clock or
            so.&quot;</i>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;That sounds fine,&quot;</i> replied Farmer Bob,
        pausing to remove his gimme cap to scratch his head.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;You'll be sure to keep some back for you and the
            missus, now won't you Bob?&quot;</i>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;Oh, you can bet on that,&quot;</i> he laughed,
        puttin' his cap back on. <i>&quot;She's got herself a whole shelf of pans dryin'
            out in the root cellar. Looks like we're gonna have ourselves a good year.&quot;</i>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmer Bob said goodbye, folded up the phone and stuffed it
        back into his hip pocket. He stood there for a while, looking out across the
        line of toads. He knew damned near every one of 'em by name. There, near one
        end, was Big Pete, his top producer. &quot;What a fine animal,&quot; thought
        Farmer Bob, a proud smile breaking across his weathered face.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and wandered back outside where the sun was just
        bursting over the east ridge behind the back sixty. The exploding, multi-colored
        mandalas spinning in his head from the night before were beginning to ease up,
        allowing a bit of normal reality to creep back in. He took out a small rolled
        toader from his zippered chest pocket and lipped it, reaching back into side
        pocket for his lighter. Giving it a flick, he lit his smoke and crouched down on
        his haunches, takin' a long drag and staring out across the farm. A flock of
        birds traced a lazy arc in the brightening sky overhead as the morning sunlight
        filtered across the frosted meadow. The music flowed out of the barn and danced
        slowly like shimmering objects in the air around him. Later, he thought, after
        the tank truck had come, he'd drive on over to the truckstop cafe for a cup o'
        joe with the neighbors.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhaling a thin stream of smoke, he heard the speaker in
        his wrist telemonitor beep, signaling the end of the milking cycle. Drawing one
        last puff, he stood up, tossing the butt to the ground and stepping on it.
        Farmer Bob took another look around before turning to go back inside, admiring
        the brilliant swirling auras surrounding the dormant peach trees as they stood
        dreaming in the orchard.
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yep, there just ain't no other life for me.&quot;
