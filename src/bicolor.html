    <p align="left">Known for skin secretions loaded with biologically active peptides. The Matses and Mayoruna tribes
        employ Phyllomedusa bicolor secretions applied to self inflicted skin burns to produce an agonizing attack of
        diarrhea, vomiting, tachycardia and systemic collapse, that is followed by a state of hyper-acuity of the senses
        attended by abundant energy and stamina without need for food or drink. Among other components, it contains
        dermorphin and deltorphin, peptides with analgesic properties 2000 times more potent than morphine at the
        cerebral level.</p>

            <font face="Arial">&quot;What begins as a
                plant hunt in the Peruvian jungle turns into a terrifying, mind-altering journey
                for amateur ethnobotanist Piers Gibbon. He's searching for the violently
                hallucinogenic Ayahuasca brew, which Amazonian shamans use to enter the spirit
                world and talk to the plants.<br>
                <br>
                Travelling deep into the jungle, Gibbon finally reaches the Brazilian border
                where he's <b>subjected to a dose of frog poison</b>. Finally, he finds a shaman
                willing to reveal his secrets - but only if Piers spends several nights alone
                drinking the Ayahuasca brew. The final initiation ceremony demands that Piers
                swallow some of the Shaman's phlegm, but how far is he prepared to go in pursuit
                of knowledge and experience?&quot;

    <p align="left">Well, bicolor eh! there's a strange one. My research disagrees
        with peter<br>
        gormans stuff about visions - both for me (one time only)&nbsp; and the matses<br>
        guys I spoke with the bicolor experience is not directly visionary<br>
        (afterwards in dreams yes perhaps)...it was for me an ordeal medicine, the<br>
        power comes from having survived it. I felt like I was going to die and then<br>
        almost wanted to, all defence shields were down (which has helped me<br>
        recognise when defence shields are up). Nasty nasty stuff, but I am glad I<br>
        did it and wd probably do it again!<br>
        <br>
        This stuff is poison, really venomous. Oh and one crucial thing you didnï¿½t<br>
        get from the programme - the venom must dry out thoroughly before use...it<br>
        may stop you breathing otherwise - please pass that info on!&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Peace!<br>
