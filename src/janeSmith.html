    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before entering the world of the usurper, we had been in a
        much brighter world, memory of which only remained in early childhood, as with
        Wadsworth, but I am sure many more children have this experience than is
        commonly believed.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Land of Light was where souls receive their instructions
        before birth. I was at the top of this class, but the idea of &quot;school&quot;
        is somewhat a misnomer. We learned directly out of the light with our breath,
        and this breath came in not only through the nostrils, but through every pore of
        the body. This learning was the same as food; we lived on it, and learning,
        living, eating and breathing were all one and the same process.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that land, there was no idea of parentage, but of brother
        and sister, and perhaps sweetheart and even husband and wife. We traveled in
        bands, but I do not remember much and that not very clearly....</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fear not for the Lord walks with you... you breathe the light.</p>
