    <p>Toads are Back!<br>
        By Oscar<br>
        <br>
        Salutations to all you pet owners out there! My friends here at Animal Care and Control send their greetings and
        hope the heat isn't getting you down.<br>
        <br>
        It's that time again where we are getting calls about toads and their effect on dogs. Our readers are talking
        about the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius) that climbs out of the mud during our Arizona monsoon season. You
        can hear these toads croaking everywhere after a good rain. They love to congregate under porch lights to catch
        bugs and scare the heck out of unsuspecting humans who just about step on them.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The main problem with these toads is they can cause toad poisoning when your pet tries to play with them. And
        most of my canine friends simply can't leave them along. Toads are strange looking and we just have to
        investigate. The most common way for us to do that is to smell or lick and that's when the trouble starts.<br>
        <br>
        Toads have skin glands that secrete toxins. Worse yet - these toxins do not have to be swallowed for their
        effects to begin. They are very easily absorbed through the pet's mouth linings. Dogs typically shows signs of
        mouth irritation, excessive drooling and abnormal breathing. Affected animals may also develop heart
        arrhythmias, seizures, weakness and collapse. Sever toxicities can quickly lead to death if not treated.<br>
        <br>
        So what do you do if you see your pet playing with a toad or suspect toad poisoning? The first and most
        important step is to wash the pet's mouth thoroughly with water. This will prevent further absorption of the
        toxin. Then call your veterinarian. Cats usually don't develop toad poisoning. Our local veterinarians tell me
        that most cases like this are seen in dogs. Lady Di tells me that "no self-respecting cat would toy with those
        ugly creatures anyway." Cats just don't know how to have a good time!

    The Colorado river toad (Bufo Alvarius), commonly found in Arizona, can pose a threat to your pets. Mouthing or
    ingestion of these toads can cause a mild to severe toxicity in dogs and cats since toads have skin glands that
    contain toxins. Toad poisoning can be diagnosed rapidly because often times the owner observes the pet playing with
    the toad. The most common initial presenting clinical signs are mouth irritation and excessive drooling. Affected
    animals may also develop heart arrhythmias, seizures, weakness, collapse, vomiting and diarrhea. Severe toxicities
    can quickly lead to death if not treated. If a pet is observed playing with a toad, rapid intervention by the owner
    is necessary. The first step is to wash the pet's mouth thoroughly with water. It is then necessary to seek
    veterinary care as soon as possible.

    Another threat is the Colorado River toad, an amphibian that can grow from tiny to dinner plate size. When stressed,
    the toads exude a toxin from glands at the back of the head � in just about the spot a dog might choose to grab
    hold. �The dog can become comatose in thirty seconds,� says Dr. Faver. �Use a hose to flush the mouth out,
    controlling the flow so it washes sideways, not down the throat, then get your dog to a vet. The toad toxin causes a
    wild heart rate and high temperatures that can be fatal. Some of my patients never learn,� recalls Dr. Faver. �One
    little guy goes after the toads after every rain.� Since the toads seek water, Dr. Faver suggests avoiding pool
    backwash areas. He also recommends limiting outside lighting which lure moths, scorpions, and other toad fare.

        Bufo Toads: Some 16 species of Bufo toads are found around the world. Bufo alvarius (Colorado River toad) is
        found in the Southwest, and Bufo marinus is found in Florida and Hawaii. Bufo's are attracted to dogs' watering
        dishes, and may sit in the rim long enough to leave enough toxin to make a dog ill. Untreated death rate,
        especially for Bufo marinus may approach 100%. Dogs may mouth bufo toads, thus getting a large dose of the
        bufo's toxins, secreted from the skin and paratid glands. Symptoms generally include profuse foamy salivation
        that looks like shaving cream, difficulty breathing, convulsions, paralysis, ventricular fibrillation, vomiting,
        cyanosis, and hallucination. Author Cargill had experience with an adult Doberman bitch, Kiku, and a Bufo
        marinus several years ago while in Hawaii. She salivated profusely, had labored breathing, an irregular heart
        beat, and the wildest-looking eyes ever seen in a Doberman. It took her the better part of a day and a night to
        recover untreated. Treatment involves dealing with three poisoning mechanisms: cardiac glycoside effects,
        pressor (tending to increase blood pressure) effects and hallucinogenic effects. Emesis (vomiting) may be
        indicated if there was a recent substantial ingestion and the dog is sufficiently alert. Repeated oral charcoal
        doses (every 2-6 hours) may help reduce the duration of poisoning. A saline cathartic or Sorbitol� may be given
        with the first charcoal dose. Intravenous insulin, glucose, and sodium bicarbonate may be required to combat
        life-threatening hyperalalkemia (elevated serum pH levels). Atropine, phenytoin and lidocane may be useful in
        the management of bradycardia (abnormally slow pulse) and other cardiac irregularities. Cholestryamine may
        enhance elimination of bufagin (one of the several bufo venon toxins). Bufo toads are not all that uncommon in
        some parts of the nation, but very serious business, indeed.
