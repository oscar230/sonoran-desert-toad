  <p align="left">The idea of toad licking really twisted the imagination of the public as it made it's way into popular
    culture through
    a <a href="news.html" target="_blank"> charade of&nbsp; media coverage</a> pretending to be news. I suppose all
    this nonsense about licking a toad to get high makes for a good
    story, though. However, <b> no toad's venom should ever be orally ingested</b>, especially
    <a href="http://www.invasivespecies.gov/profiles/canetoad.shtml" target="_blank"> Bufo
      marinus</a>, the Cane toad.&nbsp;And apparently, a law was passed in Los Angeles, California,
    stating that &quot;toads may not be licked. The toad that is referenced in this law secretes a poison that some
    people were licking to produce a heroin-like high.&quot;&nbsp;
    Sure.
  </p>
  <br>
  &quot;There�s even a story going around that people were using bufo marinus, a common, giant toad native to Costa
  Rico, that was imported into both Hawaii and Australia as an attempted control on the sugar cane beetle. The �cane
  toad� is very common in a lot of places, and I know a lot of people who have extracted samples of their venom, and
  found that it�s inactive. It doesn�t do anything. Eating it�ll make you sicker than a dog, but smoking it does
  nothing. But the story persists. There is an American native toad, bufo alvarius, called the Colorado River Toad,
  which indeed has a strong DMT-like venom, which can be smoked.&quot;

  <p align="left">Part two: This is your brain, this is your brain on toads<br>
    by Jane Musgrave<br>
    <br>
    Steve James and a Colombian friend were trying to score some weed. When they couldn�t, they decided to lick a
    toad.<br>
    <br>
    "I threw up, got a headache and was real dizzy," the now 27-year-old Broward man says of his first and only attempt
    to use venom from the bufo marinus toad to achieve the ultimate high. "It wasn�t the brightest thing to do. I don�t
    know what possessed me to do it. I guess I�m happy I�m not dead."<br>
    <br>
    Experts say James, who asked that his real name not be used, isn�t just blowing smoke. Many other adventurous
    druggies have tried to use toad juice to get high with the same, sometimes far more life-threatening, results.<br>
    <br>
    "People thought it was something you could get high with," says Dr. Richard Weisman, director of the Florida Poison
    Information Center in Miami. "Turned out it was something you could get dead with."<br>
    <br>
    The same toxins that have sent many a toad-chasing dog to the great beyond can kill a human being. The only reason
    dogs die and humans don�t is that, in most cases, humans have more sense than to put one of the ugliest animals on
    the planet in their mouths, or to sample the juice oozing from warts on its head. Also, because most humans are
    bigger than most pets, the poison generally makes humans sick as a dog rather than killing them.<br>
    <br>
    Still, the rumor persists that the venom from the bufo toad is hallucinogenic. And, actually, it is.<br>
    <br>
    But while Australians have come up with complex recipes that involve boiling, baking, buttering and bolstering the
    venom, even adventurous drug users say the health risks are too great for a buzz that isn�t worth it.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately for James and other brave, desperate or misinformed South Florida drug users, it�s not the bufo
    marinus toad that provides a non-life-threatening high; it�s the giant toad�s western cousin, the bufo alvarius
    toad.<br>
    <br>
    And despite the much-ballyhooed talk of toad licking, you don�t slurp up the venom. Rather, you dry it and then
    smoke a very tiny bit - chips about the size of three match heads.<br>
    <br>
    Unlike the marinus toad, the venom of the alvarius toad contains <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a>, a tryptamine that is one of the most powerful hallucinogens
    in nature. While the venom of the marinus contains 26 different chemical compounds, <a href="5meo.html"
      target="_blank"><SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a> isn�t one of them.<br>
    <br>
    And perhaps it�s just as well.<br>
    <br>
    Leo Mercado, president of The <a href="http://www.peyoteway.org/" target="_blank"> Peyote</a> Foundation in Kearny,
    Ariz., says the experience isn�t a particularly pleasant one.<br>
    <br>
    For one thing, it happens incredibly quickly. Within 30 seconds, it hits and it�s over in about 15 minutes.<br>
    <br>
    "It�s so shocking. You think �My God, is it supposed to kill me?� You think you�ve OD�d. You think you�re going to
    die," he says of the initial rush.<br>
    <br>
    Rather than producing strange and colorful images or pleasantly altered views of reality, the experience is
    intensely thought-twisting.<br>
    <br>
    "It�s like being blasted out of your ego into a total cosmic perspective," Mercado says. "You lose your total sense
    of self. It�s like a ride through the emotional mind. Any garbage in your life, like if you feel bad for kicking the
    dog or doing someone wrong, it brings it right out and rubs your face in it."<br>
    <br>
    Others have described it as "a rocket ship into the void."<br>
    <br>
    Even those who claim to enjoy the experience don�t make it sound inviting.<br>
    <br>
    Consider this explanation offered by a Virginia woman via the Internet: "It tasted like model glue. I took a few
    really deep breaths and got it into my lungs. You feel it immediately creeping down your spine. Within in a minute,
    I was on the ground thrashing around. I had no control of my coordination and a total loss of muscle control. I
    couldn�t speak or anything. It was great."<br>
    <br>
    Such accolades aside, Mercado says he wouldn�t recommend it, and because the experience is so intense even in
    alvarius-rich Arizona, few do it recreationally.<br>
    <br>
    Still, he says, Mother Nature knew what she was doing when she filled the sacs of the alvarius with a mind-altering
    drug.<br>
    <br>
    "You just milk the little glands and it dries right away. It�s so convenient," he says. "It�s just like,
    �Wow, this apparently was meant to be done.� It�s perfection in packaging."<br>
    <br>
    And, some note that unlike growing marijuana or mushrooms or mixing chemicals in a tube, if you develop a fondness
    for toad juice, you also get a pet.<br>
    <br>
    James says he loves reptiles, but he�ll stick with pot.<br>
    <br>
    "I don�t want to do it ever again," he says.<br>

  <p align="center"><b>Toad-Licking Blues</b></p>
  <p align="center"> Thomas Lyttle</p>
  <p>"Toad licking" or "toad smoking" are the
    terms that newspaper reporters attached to the ingestion of Bufo
    venom by users of illicit drugs. This was (and is) done with the
    intended purpose of getting stoned or high, or going into a trance
    in a Shamanic manner. (It is important to note that <a href="ott.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">bufotenine</SPAN></a><span style="text-decoration: None">
    </span>- a
    minor constituent of all Bufo toad venoms - <a href="ott.html" target="_blank">is</a> not <a href="ott.html"
      target="_blank"><SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">hallucinogenic</SPAN></a>.)
    In light of this, politicians and the courts stepped in to attempt
    to control this perceived drug-misuse problem.</p>
  <p> In 1967 the Food and Drug Administration
    placed bufotenine in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act.
    Schedule 1 maintains that a drug (or plant or substance) shows
    no redeeming medical value, is too dangerous for human research,
    and has a high potential for abuse.</p>
  <p> Bufo toads are well known as part of Shamanic
    rituals. No mention of the oral ingestion of toad venom exists
    in classic Shamanic literature, however, because the bufotenine
    present in the venom does not cause trance or mystical experiences,
    and both bufotenine and the hallucinogenic <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a> are inactive
    orally.[1] Also, <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a>
    is present in only one species of Bufo
    toad, Bufo alvarius.</p>
  <p> Toxic reactions in human and lower animals
    are common, however, and include death (in animals) from oral
    toad venom ingestion.[2] Toad smoking and toad licking should
    be profiled and studied as two distinct activities. This is an
    important consideration, especially when studying media reports
    about toad licking, which involves the oral ingestion of the venom
    only.</p>
  <p> The subject of these clandestine or cult-like
    uses of Bufo toads presents an interesting dilemma for researchers.
    The very nature of such activity makes open data-gathering troublesome.
    Anecdotal or word-of-mouth descriptions often prove invaluable
    for building a tentative profile of any illegal drug activity,
    or a legal but persecuted drug activity. This case involves alleged
    illegal bufotenine use and misuse, and legal but persecuted <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a>
    misuse.</p>
  <p> From all this (but usually with little concern
    for scientific facts), the media continue to print "psychedelic
    toad" articles, thus continuing and sensationalizing age-old Bufo
    toad mythologies, including the myth that bufotenine is hallucinogenic.
    The focus of these many popular articles are on Bufo toads and
    getting high from bufotenine and its analogs. This is confusing,
    as only one of the analogs (not bufotenine) causes hallucination.</p>
  <p> Bufo Toad Smoking</p>
  <p> In the late 1960s, LSD evangelist Art Kleps
    founded a psychedelic church called the Neo-American Church. The
    church's newsletter was called "Divine Toad Sweat".[3] In 1984,
    Bufo toad evangelist Albert Most revealed his <a href="church.html" target="_blank"> Church of the Toad
      of Light</a> with his publication of the book <a href="almost.html" target="_blank"> Bufo Alvarius:
      Psychedelic
      Toad of the Sonoran Desert</a>. The Sonoran Desert is in New Mexico.
    This small booklet details how to use the Bufo toad for ritual
    and pleasure, as well as how to catch the Bufo alvarius toad,
    extract or "milk" the glandular secretions, dry them, and "enjoy
    the smoked venom." Most's book claims that <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a> (5-methoxy-N,
    N-dimethyltryptamine) is the active hallucinogen, not bufotenine.
    He is correct, as <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a>
    is the O-methylated version of bufotenine.[4]
    Again, it is important to mention that <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a> is present in
    only one of the more than 200 types of Bufo toads.</p>
  <p> Bufotenine is illegal to possess in the
    United States because it is a Schedule I drug, even though <a href="ott.html" target="_blank"> it
      is</a> not psychoactive; <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a> is unscheduled and legal to possess,
    even though it is psychoactive. This makes <a href="5meo.html" target="_blank"><SPAN
        STYLE="Text-Decoration : None">5-MeO-DMT</SPAN></a> potentially
    illegal in the US as an analog of bufotenine or DMT, by application
    of the 1987 drug analog act. Possession of only one type of Bufo
    toad (the type that contains both substances in endogenous forms)
    for the purpose of getting "stoned or high" or for sacramental
    use remains in legal limbo, pending legislative debate, which
    is ongoing at the time of this writing. Although seemingly farfetched,
    conspiracy to possess a (certain type of) Bufo toad may someday
    be a civil violation or a crime in the United States.</p>

  <p align="left"><A name="moredebate">From</A> personal email correspondence with Tom Lyttle in September
    2002 regarding the debate as to whether bufotenine is hallucinogenic or not:









  <p align="left">I [Tom Lyttle] wrote <a href="abstracts.html" target="_blank"> the lengthy paper</a> on the toad
    with David Goldstein and Jochen
    Gartz. <a href="ott.html#debate" target="_blank"> Ott's response to me is hilarious.</a> First he says I'm
    unreliable because I never ingested bufotenine and I say its non-hallucinogenic, then Ott supports those who also
    have never taken toad venom but say it IS hallucinogenic. Think about the logic here.<br>
    <br>
    I'm also wary of the uses of terms like "pharmacodynamics" (Ott is a great name dropper), by one person sitting in a
    cabin with no witnesses, let alone no lab equipment or scientific controls. By the way I'm on the editorial board of
    <a href="http://www.entheomedia.com/index.htm" target="_blank"> Entheos</a>, a respected journal.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I stand by my JPD article that the effects (with pure bufotenine) are mostly due to starving the optic nerve and
    sinus cavities (and the brain somewhat) of oxygen. There are a plethora of papers which describe
    arrhythmia surrounding the optic nerve and sinus re: bufotenine. Naturally Ott sidesteps all this.<br>
    <br>
    However I think the truth of the matter lays somewhere in between Ott and myself. I am looking forward to reading
    Ott's new book on snuffs, and then perhaps I will re-enter the debate on bufotenine.<br>
    <br>
    I will be happy to admit I'm wrong when a few folks independent of Ott support or replicate his bufotenine claims
    with controlled experiments.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Regarding Ott, his work is outstanding and no doubt something happened when he ingested his bufotenine. It may come
    down to differences between us in defining the words "psychedelic" and "hallucination".&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Anyhow it's a lovely debate that continues.&nbsp;









  <p align="left">&nbsp;









  <p align="left">Tom Lyttle further elaborates on his position in an email in
    June 2003:









  <p align="left">Regarding Mr. Ott, I don't take him too seriously, but you can print this letter if you want. I'm
    still
    saying the source of the bufotenine, maybe even the persons using it, connect to it's psychedelic or
    non-psychedelic, or deadly poison status. Ott tested bufotenine snuffs and plant versions only, not the rest of the
    world's bufotenine.<br>
    <br>
    Ott assumes that various bufotenine molecules must be equal, according to chromatography and assay. He concludes
    that analysis of plant-derived versions apply across the board. This is regardless of synthetic, animal, human,
    mushroom or plant origin.<br>
    <br>
    What he avoids mentioning in his book - even while attacking me - is that 100 papers from world-class chemists saw
    bufotenine a terms of poison, not psychedelic by any stretch - and they also used chromatography equipment to prove
    their case. Does
    Ott think Harris Isbell or <a
      href="http://de1.erowid.org/culture/characters/shulgin_alexander/shulgin_alexander.html" target="_blank"> Sasha
      Shulgin</a> were pulling his leg in describing "purpling of the face" and feelings of "impending death". Rewriting
    Shulgin to suit, Ott changes the paper's tone emphasizing the words "showed psychoactivity", slanting things away
    from deadly poison. Shulgin
    definitely said and meant "poisoning", that's what his analysis showed. Ott says nothing of other major scientist's
    reports, especially the totally contradicting his snuff-sourced bufotenine as "psychedelic". Both sides used TLC
    equipment for purity standards, many did assays. The bulk contradict Ott.&nbsp;<br>

    The major assertion in my paper, which Ott again avoids commenting on, is that bufotenine is an alchemical, magical
    substance. It appears as panacea or poison according to hidden "alchemic seasons", it's source (toads, scientists in
    a lab, plants, mushrooms, schizophrenic's blood). Even the folks who handle it could play some role, according to
    shamans.<br>
    <br>
    Ott also avoids commenting on bufotenine as an ataxia agent (ultra-quick oxygen starvation,
    extreme physical/mental reactions). Bufotenine cuts oxygen off deadly fast. This fucks with the optic and sinus
    nerves big time, causing major sinus
    arrhythmia. The optic nerve sits in close proximity, it also would be affected. This, in my opinion, accounts for
    some totally bizarre optical effects, mistakenly called hallucination.<br>
    <br>
    Ott's calling anoxia, optical nerve damage and impaired vision "hallucinatory effects" is beyond me. Again, the
    visuals described in human experiments seem like visual "distortion" more in liner with nerve-damage, seizure,
    optical migraines. Bufotenine visuals show color loss,
    appear in extreme black and white, fixed-pattern like checkerboards appear.<br>
    <br>
    This is consistent with optical nerve damage, the theories of "hallucinatory constants". Such "constants&quot;
    (square, checkerboard, filigree, etc.) which seemed specific to mescaline, got researched by early researchers like
    Heinrich Kluver. The theory was that "form constants" would appear when specific nerves in the eye got stimulated.
    This isn't hallucination however.<br>
    <br>
    Photography effects were also seen by some, everything appearing as "negatives". Ott needs to read. Other forms of
    optic nerve damage or seizure, including optical
    migraines, match other bufotenine imagery. The bufotenine visuals reported by Isbell, such were quite pronounced,
    aren't found in Ott.<br>
    <br>
    Ott needs to study synthetic bufotenine, toad bufotenine, mushroom bufotenine, every other type of bufotenine, and
    various bufotenine salts. His assumption that thin-layer chromatography and semi-scientific assays as comprehension,
    well gee whiz.<br>
    <br>
    I'd even assay bufotenine according to circadian-rhythm theory, time of day consumption. The AMA
    recently ran ads for new circadian-based drugs w/ maximize effects, absorption, metabolism according to the time of
    day one takes the pill. Placebo theory might also be mentioned. Also, science papers on Ketamine and Salvia show
    dramatic differences in affect, according ingesting in light or dark. In the case of the totally hallucinogenic
    Salvia divinorum, daytime reports from user include "nothing
    happened". While night users reported, "I couldn't find the floor, dead Indians floated by, etc."&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    My paper was on toad bufotenine, Ott's studied Anadenanthera bufotenine. This is an important distinction lost to
    Ott. He may be reducing everything via chemistry, chromatography, assay agenda's. In my opinion the jury is still
    out BIG TIME on this whole affair, until a complete assay of bufotenine from all known sources appears.<br>
    <br>
    Ott was dismissive, almost rude towards my bufotenine/toad paper in his "Shamanic Snuffs". Strangely, the bulk of
    this 22 page paper was on toad mythology, urban legends like "toad-licking" and biographic history. A smaller
    section included science and medical experiments, chemistry and pharmacology, most contradicting the psychedelic
    bufotenine idea.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I will admit to over-stating my case re: bufotenine not being psychedelic. I should have said "major science
    references contradict" instead of stating things as fact. Ott's brief nit-picking in his review was hilarious and
    almost sad. His seeing an obscure referencing
    omission as critical enough to rant on - all this in an article with 612 citations. What can I say? Dr. Shulgin was
    the peer-review editor assigned to me by the
    <a href="http://www.hafci.org/journal/" target="_blank">Journal Of Psychoactive
      Drugs</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="ott.html#debate" target="_blank">Ott's long-nosed criticism</a> of my paper says my work is
    "outstanding for
    its repetitive wrong-headedness". Says who? A bit premature, owing to the bulk of science still needed to set the
    issue to rest. No final word has appeared, regardless of Ott's dictums. New chromatography and assays are lacking
    re: the bulk of bufotenines from various sources. Ott proved that plant-bufotenine is
    hallucinogenic. He did not prove all bufotenine is hallucinogenic. Come back after you study the synthetic versions,
    toad versions, endogenous versions found in schizophrenics, mushroom
    versions, plus various salts. And explain to Shulgin where he went so wrong in his analysis.<br>
    <br>
    I'll say I was wrong re: bufotenine being non-psychedelic - when I'm proven wrong. This won't be the case until
    after we see some comparative analysis. Plus see assays more creative (and more serious) than Ott's "bufotenine
    enema's".<br>
