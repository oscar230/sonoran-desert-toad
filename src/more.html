        AB: Toads of the Genus Bufo protract the tongue in a ballistic manner during prey capture. Kinematics analyses
        have shown the tongue of the toad Bufo alvarius moving with maximum velocities greater than 2 m/s and
        accelerations exceeding 1000 m/s2 during feeding. One goal of this study is to elucidate how B. alvarius is able
        to catapult the tongue out of the mouth with such large velocities and accelerations. I suggest that the tongue
        is spring-loaded in the mouth prior to mouth opening. While the tongue is rolled forward towards its anterior
        attachment point, the mouth-opening muscles (depressors) and mouth-closing muscles (levators) fire
        simultaneously, and the mouth remains closed. Then, a signal reaches the levators, inactivating both the tonic
        and phasic elements of these muscles and allowing the depressors to open the mouth at high velocity. As the
        lower jaw drops down, the tongue is thrown out over the lower jaw tip with a straight-line anterior trajectory.
        Once the tongue tip has passed over the lower jaw tip, inertia carries the tongue to maximum protraction. Via
        this mechanism, the tongue able to exit the mouth with great velocities and accelerations, enabling it to
        lengthen as it is protracted. In order for this mechanism of tongue protraction to operate, the movements of the
        tongue and jaws must be precisely coordinated. The paired hypoglossal nerves facilitate this coordination.
        Proprioceptive information about the tongue, carried by hypoglossal afferents, is used to modulate the activity
        of the jaw levators. Further, both hypoglossal afferents must be operational in order for the ballistic
        mechanism to produce maximum tongue protraction.<br>

        AB: There are several potential structural and functional consequences of an animal changing size. As the whole
        animal grows, individual components that make up complex functional systems, such as the feeding mechanism, may
        grow at varying rates. To explore this issue, we examined the feeding system of the Colorado River Toad, Bufo
        alvarius, modeled as a simple mechanical lever system. We evaluated several aspects of the feeding mechanism,
        including skull measurements, linear jaw measurements, mechanical advantage of jaw opening and closing, jaw
        opening and closing musculature and in vivo bite forces. Components of the feeding system were scaled against
        body length in order to test for isometry and establish relative growth rates. The sample size included 30
        animals ranging from 15 to 130 mm in body length as well as a separate group of 12 live toads in this size
        range, which were used to acquire bite forces. The results of the changing skull and jaw morphology were related
        to existing feeding kinematics for Bufo alvarius of a similar size range. Mechanical advantage remained constant
        for both jaw opening and closing, though the lever arms measured to determine mechanical advantage were not
        isometric with respect to body size. The predicted jaw Closing force was very similar to that observed in vivo,
        but also did not scale isometrically with size. The results of the predicted jaw Opening forces however did not
        match that observed through kinematics, suggesting that some other component not explored in this study is
        active in the ballistic tongue protraction mechanism of this species.<br>

        AB: This study explores the role of hypoglossal sensory feedback during feeding in the toad Bufo alvarius. Prior
        studies indicate that sensory feedback from the hypoglossal nerves can trigger inhibition of both tonic and
        phasic activity of the jaw levator muscles. Temporary inhibition of the jaw levators allows the jaw depressors
        to produce rapid mouth opening. Following bilateral hypoglossal transection, the levators and depressors fire
        simultaneously, preventing mouth opening during feeding attempts. Utilizing unilateral rather than bilateral
        hypoglossal transections, coupled with high-speed digital videography and EMG recordings from the jaw levators
        and depressors, I have further investigated hypoglossal feedback control of the anuran jaw musculature.
        Preliminary data show that while the mouth opens following unilateral transection, the velocity of mouth opening
        and the maximum gape angle are reduced. These results suggest that transection of the hypoglossal nerve on one
        side prevents the inhibition of tonic and phasic activity of the jaw levators only on that same side. Hence, on
        that side of the jaw, the levators and depressors may be firing simultaneously, resisting the efforts of the
        contralateral depressors to open the mouth and therefore reducing the speed and maximum gape angle of mouth
        opening. According to this scenario, each hypoglossal nerve carries information back to the central nervous
        system in a unilateral fashion. Nerve staining studies are currently being conducted to further test this
        hypothesis.<br>

        AB: Toads normally obtain water by absorption across their skin from osmotically dilute sources. When
        hyperosmotic salt solutions are presented as a hydration source to dehydrated desert toads, they place the
        ventral skin onto the source but soon afterwards escape to avoid dehydration. The escape behavior coincides with
        neural excitation of the spinal nerves that innervate putative chemosensory cells in the ventral skin. In the
        present study, fluorescent dye translocated through the spinal nerves to those receptor cells in the epidermis
        was photoconverted in the presence of 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for electron-microscopic
        observation of the cells and associated nerve terminals. Most of the photoconverted cells were located in the
        deepest layer of the epidermis, with some being in more intermediate layers. No labeled cell was seen in the
        outermost layer of living cells. In desert toads, flask cells and Merkel cells are occasionally seen in the
        epidermis. An association of nerve fibers with these epidermal cells has been reported in some species of the
        anurans. In the present study, however, the cytological features of the photoconverted cells are neither
        reminiscent of flask cells nor Merkel cells, but are similar to those of surrounding epithelial cells in each
        layer of the epidermis. We hypothesize a sensory function for these cells, because they have a close association
        with nerve fibers and participate in the transepithelial transport of salts that must pass through all cell
        layers of the skin.<br>

        AB: We investigated breeding activity of a community of desert anurans at two sites in north-central Phoenix,
        Maricopa County, Arizona, during 1990-1995. Four species used these sites for breeding during the summer monsoon
        season: Colorado River toad, Bufo alvarius, Great Plains toad, B. cognatus, red-spotted toad, B. punctatus, and
        Couch's spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus couchii. Breeding activity was restricted primarily to 1990 and 1992 when
        significant rainfall events (>25 mm of rainfall within 24 h) occurred repeatedly. No breeding (i.e.,
        oviposition) occurred during 1991 or 1993, and only S. couchii bred on a single night in 1994 and B. alvarius on
        a single night in 1995. We undertook a skeletochronologic analysis of lines of arrested growth in digits and
        femurs with all four study species. Conservative estimates of age based on lines of arrested growth (LAG's)
        suggest that populations of all four taxa were relatively young (average age between two and four years) at both
        sites in 1994 and 1995. Growth, as indicated by the amount of bone deposited between LAG's, was greatest during
        the second year in B. alvarius and B. cognatus, but not B. punctatus or S. couchii. These results indicate rapid
        growth to maturity but do not support the notion that these anuran amphibians are long-lived organisms that
        exhibit an extended reproductive lifespan as adults in response to a highly variable, harsh desert
        environment.<br>

        AB: Putative hybrid toads of the genus Bufo were collected in central Arizona and identified using allozymes,
        qualitative and quantitative morphological characters, and release call characteristics. Data suggest one hybrid
        resulted from mating between Bufo cognatus and Bufo woodhousii, and the other three resulted from matings
        between Bufo alvarius and B. woodhousii. Natural hybridization between these taxa has not been previously
        reported. To date, B. woodhousii has been found to hybridize with four species of the Bufo americanus species
        group, of which B. woodhousii is a member, and five other species which represent three outgroups to the B.
        americanus group. Fossil evidence suggests some genomic compatability has been retained between B. alvarius and
        B. woodhousii despite at least 6 million years of independent evolution. Hybridization among members of Bufo may
        be due to alternative mating tactics of males, such as active searching, and by alteration of historicalhabitats
        in central Arizona.<br>

        AB: We studied variation in advertisement calls, release calls, and calling behavior in three populations of
        Bufo alvarius in central Arizona over a 3-yr period. Of advertisement call variables, pulse rate was the only
        variable significantly (positively) related to temperature, and no variables were correlated with male
        snout-vent length. For release calls only pulse rate was significantly (negatively) related to temperature, and
        no variables were related to male size. Mean advertisement call pulse rate was approximately 30% of average
        release call pulse rate; such dramatic differences in temporal structure of advertisement and release calls are
        previously unreported in the genus Bufo. These results support the hypothesis that B. alvarius generates
        advertisement calls without passive vibrations of the arytenoid cartilages. Overall patterns of call variation
        in B. alvarius more closely parallel the valliceps rather than the boreas species group. Preliminary
        discrimination trials indicate that females are attracted to malt, advertisement calls. Within relatively low
        density choruses, some large males produced advertisement calls consistently, and active-searching behavior was
        size-related. Male advertisement calls may play an important role in mate selection by females under some
        conditions, but an adequate test of this hypothesis awaits additional study.<br>

        AB: Anthropologists have long speculated that ancient peoples of Mesoamerica used a toad, Bufo marinus, as a
        ritual intoxicant. This hypothesis rests on many iconographic and mythological representations of toads and on a
        number of speculative ethnographic reports. The authors reject B. marinus as a candidate for such use because of
        the toxicity of its venom. A more likely candidate is the Sonoran desert toad, Bufo alvarius, which secretes
        large amounts of the potent known hallucinogen, 5-methoxy-NN-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT). The authors
        demonstrate that the venom of B. alvarius, although known to be toxic when consumed orally, may be safely smoked
        and is powerfully psychoactive by that route of administration. These experiments are the first documentation of
        an hallucinogenic agent from the animal kingdom, and they provide clear evidence of a psychoactive toad that
        could have been employed by Precolumbian peoples of the New World.<br>

        AB: Bones of 51 species of vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals were recovered
        from a sedimentary deposit at Rancho la Brisca in north-central Sonora, Mexico. The fauna was preserved in a
        marshy cienega habitat with 49.0% of the species and 87.2% of the identified bones representing aquatic and
        semiaquatic animals. The most common animals in the fauna are Kinosternon sonoriense (Sonoran Mud Turtle) and
        Rana "pipiens:-complex (Leopard Frog). The presence of Bison species (Bison) in association with Mammuthus
        species (Mammoth), Equus cf. tau (Pygmy Onager), and Camelops species (Camel) places the fauna in the
        Rancholabrean Land Mammal Age. Bufo cf. kelloggi (Little Mexican Toad), B. mazatlanensis (Sinaloa Toad),
        Leptodactylus melanonotus (Sabinal Frog), pternohyla fodiens (Burrowing Treefrog), and Masticophis cf.
        mentovarius (Tropical Whipsnake) are subtropical thornscrub or Sonoran Desert animals that presently occur to
        the south and/or west of la Brisca. Bufo alvarus (Colorado River Toad), cf. Callisaurus draconoides
        (Zebra-tailed Lizard), and Sceloporus cf. clarkii (Clark's Spiny Lizard) are other Sonoran Desert animals that
        suggest a paleoclimate with warm winters and a well-developed summer monsoon. The best modern analog for the
        paleocommunity would be about 240 km SSE on the Rio Yaqui. The subtropical elements in the la Brisca fauna make
        it unlikely that the fauna was deposited during a glacial period, considering that the Late Wisconsin
        paleoclimatic reconstructions for Arizona [USA] based on plant remains in packrat middens suggest glacial
        climates with mild, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The fauna represents an interglacial environment
        subsequent to the appearance of Bison about 150 000 years ago in the Sangamon Interglacial and with a climate to
        that of the Late Holocene of the last 4000 years. The distributions of fish and mud turtles suggest past stream
        connections between the Gila River drainage in southeastern Arizona and the rivers in Sonora. In contrast,
        Pseudemys scripta (Yaqui Slider) apparently never entered Arizona, although it reaches north-central Sonora
        today.<br>

        carolinensis; the rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox. The .alpha.-MSH analog was a superpotent agonist in the in vitro
        frog (R. pipiens, R. catesbeiana) and lizard (A. carolinensis) skin bioassays. In all species studied, the
        analog exhibited ultraprolonged melanotropic activity, both in vitro and in vivo. This MSH and related analogs
        should prove useful in the study of numerous physiological processes, particularly when prolonged melanotropic
        activity is desired.<br>

        AB: Specific dynamic action (SDA), the accumulated energy expended on all physiological processes associated
        with meal digestion, is strongly influenced by features of both the meal and the organism. We assessed the
        effects of meal size, meal type, body temperature, and body size on the postprandial metabolic response and
        calculated SDA of the marine toad, Bufo marinus. Peak postprandial rates of O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2
        production (VCO2) and SDA increased with meal size (5%-20% of body mass). Postprandial metabolism was impacted
        by meal type; the digestion of hard-bodied superworms (Zophobas larva) and crickets was more costly than the
        digestion of soft-bodied earthworms and juvenile rats. An increase in body temperature (from 20degree to
        35degreeC) altered the postprandial metabolic profile, decreasing its duration and increasing its magnitude, but
        did not effect SDA, with the cost of meal digestion remaining constant across body temperatures. Allometric mass
        exponents were 0.69 for standard metabolic rate, 0.85 for peak postprandial VO2, and 1.02 for SDA; therefore,
        the factorial scope of peak postprandial VO2 increased with body mass. The mass of nutritive organs (stomach,
        liver, intestines, and kidneys) accounted for 38% and 20% of the variation in peak postprandial VO2 and SDA,
        respectively. Toads forced to exercise experienced 25-fold increases in VO2, much greater than the 5.5-fold
        increase experience during digestion. Controlling for meal size, meal type, and body temperature, the specific
        dynamic responses of B. marinus are similar to those of the congeneric Bufo alvarius, Bufo boreas, Bufo
        terrestris, and Bufo woodhouseii.<br>

        AB:  A review of the neuropharmacology of the alleged hallucinogen
        bufotenine is presented, including recent experimental results showing activity
        similar to LSD and other known hallucinogens (psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT) at the
        purported hallucinogenic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. In
        addition, current reports of computer modeling of the receptors and ligand
        binding sites give evidence of bufotenine's ability to bind and activate these
        receptors. While binding and activation of the purported hallucinogenic
        receptors are not the full extent of the hallucinogenic signature, this evidence
        shows support for the rationale that the reported lack of the drug's classic
        hallucinogenic response in human experiments is due to poor ability to cross the
        blood brain barrier (BBB), not lack of activation of the appropriate brain
        receptors. Further evidence is reviewed that in some physiological states, some
        drugs with characteristics similar to bufotenine which do not normally cross the
        BBB, cross it and enter the brain. While direct human experimental evidence of
        bufotenine's hallucinogenic activity seems lacking, the above combined factors
        are considered, and possible explanations of bufotenine's reported
        psychoactivity are suggested. Additionally, updated experimental models testing
        the possible nature of bufotenine's hallucinogenic potential are proposed.<br>

        AB:  The leaves of the perennial pasture grass Phalaris aquatica L. (phalaris)
        contain two groups of known toxins, indole alkaloids, primarily
        dimethyltryptamines and N-methyltyramines, which cause illnesses in grazing
        animals, especially sheep. Using amino-reactive and phenolic hydroxyl-reactive
        homobifunctional reagents, simple methods were devised for coupling toxins
        representative of those in phalaris to carrier proteins and enzymes for ELISA
        development. ELISAs were produced for both groups of toxins. Dimethyltryptamines
        were most sensitively detected (lower limit of detection (LLD) of 1 mug/L for
        bufotenine) using rabbit anti-bufotenine antibodies, coupled to ovalbumin using
        divinyl sulfone, with detection using a peroxidase conjugate prepared using the
        same hapten coupled with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether. The assay
        cross-reacted with other toxins of the same class (N,N-dimethyltryptamine and
        N,N-dimethyl-5-methoxytryptamine) but not with the structurally related amino
        acids histidine and tryptophan. The most sensitive N-methyltyramine assay (LLD
        of 1 mug/mL for N-methyltyramine) utilized antisera to tyramine with N-methyltyramine
        coupled to peroxidase. Significant cross-reaction was seen with the low-grade
        toxin hordenine, but detection of tyramine was poorer, whereas the amino acid
        tyrosine was not detected. These assays could be applied to the analysis of
        simple extracts of Phalaris leaves with minimal interference. A good
        correspondence was observed between toxin levels by ELISA and estimates from a
        more tedious thin-layer chromatography method. The method has now been
        incorporated in a Phalaris breeding program.<br>

        AB:  Development of a rapid, sensitive and selective method for the
        determination of antimigraine drugs from human serum is essential for
        understanding the pharmacokinetics of these drugs when administered
        concurrently. Solid phase extraction (SPE) using Oasis HLB was used to extract
        the drugs (sumatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan and rizatriptan) and the
        internal standard bufotenine from serum. A method based on liquid
        chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was developed and validated
        to simultaneously quantitate these antimigraine drugs from human serum. The
        precursor and major product ions of the analytes were monitored on a triple
        quadrupole mass spectrometer with positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) in
        the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The base peak in all the analytes
        is formed by alpha cleavage associated with protonation of the secondary amine.
        Mechanisms for the formation of the collision-induced dissociation products of
        these antimigraine compounds are proposed. Linear calibration curves were
        generated from 1-100 ng/mL with all coefficients of determination greater than
        0.99. The inter- and intraday precision (%RSD) were less than 9.3% and accuracy
        (%error) was less than 9.8% for all components. The limits of detection (LOD)
        for the method were 250 pg/mL for sumatriptan and 100 pg/mL for the remaining
        analytes based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.<br>

        AB:  1. A series of N-substituted tryptamines was trained to discriminate
        LSD (0.1 mg/kg) from saline. 2. Intermediate levels of substitution were
        elicited by MDMT (76.4%), DMT (77.9%), and DET (48.7%). 6-F-DET produced 41.3%
        LSD-appropriate responding at a dose of 6.0 mg/kg but only 4 of 8 subjects
        completed the test session thus precluding statistical analysis. Bufotenine
        (25.8%) also failed to substitute. Although none of the tryptamines substituted
        completely for LSD, the pattern of substitution  is consonant with what is
        known of their activity in humans. MDMT, DMT, and DET are well established in
        the literature as hallucinogens but the same cannot be said for 6-F-DET and
        bufotenine. 3. Of the beta-carbolines tested, none substituted for LSD
        completely and only harmane elicited intermediate substitution (49.5%). No
        significant generalization of the LSD stimulus to 6-methoxyharmalan, harmaline,
        or THBC was observed. Thus, in contrast to the tryptamines, scant ability to
        substitute for  LSD was observed in the beta-carbolines tested. 4. Taken
        together, the present data indicate that the representative tryptamines employed
        in the present study exhibit greater similarity to the LSD stimulus than do
        representative betacarbolines. The receptor interactions responsible for these
        differences remain to be determined.<br>

        AB:  Several models of agonist binding to G protein-coupled
        5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (serotonin) receptors have highlighted the potential
        importance of highly conserved aromatic residues for ligand binding and agonist
        efficacy. In this study, we tested these models by constructing and
        characterizing a number of point mutations of conserved and nonconserved
        aromatic residues using the 5-HT-2A receptor as a model system. Mutations of
        three highly conserved tryptophans (W200A, W336A, and W367A) proposed to reside
        near the binding pocket markedly reduced agonist affinity and efficacy at
        5-HT-2A receptors. Mutations of two other highly conserved aromatic residues
        postulated to be near the agonist binding site (F340L and Y370A) also had
        dramatic effects on agonist binding and efficacy. Point mutations of neighboring
        conserved phenylalanines (F339L and F365L) had minimal effects on agonist
        binding, although the F365L mutation diminished agonist efficacy. Finally,
        mutations of two nonconserved aromatic residues (F125L and F383A) not predicted
        to be near the binding pocket had no effects on agonist binding, potency, or
        efficacy. Our results are best explained by models that suggest that helices
        III, V, VI, and VII can form a unit of interacting helices in which highly
        conserved aromatic residues are oriented toward the center of the helical
        aggregate to form an aromatic pocket. In addition, our novel results identify a
        series of aromatic residues essential for agonist-induced second messenger
        production. These results demonstrate that highly conserved aromatic residues
        residing in neighboring helices provide the optimum environment for both agonist
        binding and activation of 5-HT-2A receptors.<br>

        AB:  We have stably expressed the rat 5-HT-6 receptor in HEK293 cells at a
        density of gt 2 pmol/mg protein, as determined in equilibrium binding studies
        with (3H)-LSD and (3H)-5-HT and compared the affinity of a range of compounds in
        competition binding experiments with either (3H)-LSD or (3H)-5-HT as radioligand.
        A variety of tryptamine derivatives were tested and showed a significantly
        higher affinity when the 5-HT-6 receptor was labelled with (3H)-5-HT, whereas
        ergoline compounds and several antagonists had higher affinities when (3H)-LSD
        was used as radioligand. Subsequently we examined the ability of LSD, 5-HT and a
        number of tryptamine derivatives to stimulate cAMP accumulation in order to
        determine their agonist potency and efficacy. We observed the following rank
        order of potency: LSD gt omega-N-methyl-5-HT apprxeq bufotenine apprxeq
        5methoxytryptamine gt 5-HT gt 2-methyl-5-HT apprxeq 5-benzyloxytryptamine
        apprxeq tryptamine gt 5-carboxamidotryptamine mchgt 5-HTQ. LSD, lisuride,
        2-methyl-5-HT, tryptamine and 5-benzyloxytryptamine behaved as partial agonists
        relative to 5-HT. The rank order of potency of the tryptamine compounds
        correlated well with their affinities determined in binding assays. In addition,
        we have tested a number of antagonists in this system (rank order of potency:
        methiothepin, clozapine, mianserin and ritanserin). This characterization of the
        pharmacological properties of recombinant 5-HT-6 receptor will facilitate the

        AB:  This study investigated the pathways to many monoamines and their
        metabolites in the central nervous system of the frog Rana nigromaculata and the
        toad Bufo bufo japonicus during embryonic development and metamorphosis.
        Metabolites were analyzed by three-dimensional HPLC. The two species provided
        evidence of similar pathways, with slightly different timetables for the
        development of their monoamine systems. During embryonic development, the main
        metabolic pathways in entire embryos were tyrosine (TYR) fwdarw
        (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in Bufo) fwdarw 3-hydroxytyramine fwdarw
        norepinephrine or epinine (EPIN) fwdarw epinephrine, TYR fwdarw tyramine fwdarw
        (octopamine in Rana) and TYR fwdarw 3-O-methyldopa for catecholamines, and
        tryptophan fwdarw kynurenine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) fwdarw
        (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and N-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (N-MET) in Bufo).
        The monoamine system in the brain was similar during metamorphosis to that
        during embryogenesis with a few exceptions. The most striking change was the
        development of the bufotenine (5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) pathway from
        5-HT via N-MET. EPIN and norepinephrine in Rana and octopamine in both species
        disappeared during metamorphosis. These results are discussed in relation to the
        roles of the various pathways in development.<br>

        AB:  In this study, the relationship between high-affinity agonist binding
        and second messenger production was examined at native and mutant
        5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors. At native 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors all
        agonists, with the exception of quipazine, discriminated between high- and
        low-affinity states of the receptor, as determined by analysis of competition
        binding assays. There was no correlation between the ability of selected
        agonists to label the high-affinity agonist state and to augment
        phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Quipazine, which did not discriminate between the
        affinity states of the receptor, behaved as a full agonist. Similar results were
        obtained when a point mutation (F340L) of a highly conserved phenylalanine
        located in transmembrane domain VI was examined. With the F340L mutant, most of
        the agonists tested labeled significantly fewer high-affinity sites, compared
        with the native receptor. There was no significant relationship between
        high-affinity agonist binding and second messenger production. Bufotenine and
        4-iodo-3,5-dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine labeled similar percentages of
        high-affinity agonist binding sites (22% vs. 26%), but
        4-iodo-3,5-dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine behaved as a full agonist, whereas
        bufotenine was devoid of detectable agonist activity. The inability of selected
        agonists to activate phosphoinositide hydrolysis was not due solely to lower
        agonist affinity for the mutant receptor, because the binding affinity of
        quipazine was unchanged by the F340L mutation but quipazine had no detectable
        agonist activity at the mutant receptor. Our results demonstrate that the
        ability of an agonist to promote the high-affinity state of the
        5-hydroxytryptamine-2, receptor is not correlated with its ability to augment
        second messenger production. These results are consistent with recent models of
        G protein-receptor functioning (e.g., modified ternary complex model) that
        predict that additional transition states of the receptor-ligand complex are
        essential for agonist e!<br>

        was PTZ gt yohimbine gt bufotenine gt quinine gt isatin gt flumazenil, in terms
        of % entries on the open arms of the maze, whereas the magnitude of endogenous
        MAO A inhibition was PTZ gt yohimbine gt bufotenine gt quinine gt flumazenil gt
        isatin. The results indicate that the MAO A inhibitory component of tribulin,
        rather than its MAO B inhibitory component, may be responsible for the
        postulated function of tribulin as an endogenous marker of anxiety.<br>

        AB:  This study was undertaken to investigate the pharmacology of human
        serotonin (5-HT)-1D receptor sites by measuring two functional cellular
        responses, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation and promotion of
        cell growth, using transfected rat C6-glial cell lines and a broad series of
        5-HT receptor agonists. Stable and separate transfection of a pcDNA3 or pRcRSV
        plasmid, each containing a cloned human 5-HT-1D receptor gene, in rat C6-glial
        cells was confirmed with RT-PCR of 5-HT-1D receptor mRNA and radioligand binding
        with (3H) 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and (3H) sumatriptan. The 5-HT-1D
        receptor density was 350 and 1050 fmol/mg protein for the
        C6-glial/pcDNA3/5-HT-1D and C6-glial/pRcRSV/5-HT-1D cell line, and forskolin
        (100 mu-M)-induced cAMP formation was inhibited by 45 and 78% in the presence of
        1 mu-M 5HT, respectively. A comparison of the intrinsic agonist activities for
        sixteen 5-HT receptor ligands with their corresponding binding affinities for
        the human 5-HT-1D receptor site showed similar results for both cell lines with
        the exception of the partial agonist m-trifluoro-phenyl-piperazine (TFMPP).
        Three classes of compounds were observed: 1) efficacious agonists, such as 5-CT,
        5-methoxytryptamine, 5HT, sumatriptan, bufotenine,
        5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)1H-indole (RU 24,969), tryptamine and
        8hydroxy-2(di-n-propilamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), with agonist potency close to
        their binding affinity; 2) the partial agonists metergoline,
        7-trifluoromethyl-4(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrolo-(1,2-a) quinoxaline (CGS
        12066B), 1-naphthylpiperazine and
        2'-methyl-4-(5-methyl-(1,2,4)oxadiazol3-yl)-biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid
        (4-methoxy-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-phenyl)-amide (GR 127,935) with marked
        intrinsic agonist activity but at concentrations higher than their binding
        affinity; and 3) the silent antagonists ritanserin, ketanserin and methiothepin,
        apparently free of intrinsic agonist activity, with antagonist potency close to
        their binding affinity. The cAMP data were furthe!<br>
        r supported by the observed promotion of cell growth by stimulation of both
        transfected cell lines with sumatriptan under serum-free conditions;
        half-maximal stimulation was obtained at 4.4 nM (C6-glial/pcDNA3/5-HT-1D) fully
        in agreement with its EC-50-value (5.7 nM) for inhibition of cAMP formation.
        This growth promoting effect was antagonised by 1 mu-M methiothepin and not
        observed in pcDNA3-plasmid-transfected and non-transfected C6-glial cells. A
        comparative study with a C6-glial/pcDNA3/5-HT-1B cell line expressing a similar
        amount of cloned human 5-HT-1B receptors (B-max: 360 fmol/mg protein) showed
        almost no intrinsic agonist activity for metergoline, 1-naphtylpiperazine and GR
        127,935. Together with the 5-HT-1D receptor binding selectivity and antagonist
        activity of ketanserin and ritanserin, the findings define important
        pharmacological differences between cloned human 5-HT-1D and 5-HT-1B receptor
        sites.<br>

        of 15 of 18 patients with depression. Thirteen of 15 schizophrenic patients were

        AB:  Intrinsic activities of serotonin (5-HT) receptor ligands at cloned
        human 5-HT-1Dbeta receptor sites were determined by measuring cAMP responses in
        two permanently transfected cell types: rat C6-glial and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1
        cells. Both transfected cell lines expressed a similar 5-HT-1Dbeta receptor
        density (361 to 448 fmol/mg protein) and displayed a number of similar cAMP
        responses: marked inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation by 5-HT; a
        similar agonist potency and efficacy with 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT),
        5-methoxytryptamine, bufotenine, sumatriptan,
        7-trifluoromethyl-4(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrolo(1,2-a)quinoxaline (CGS
        12066B), 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)1H-indole (RU 24,969), and
        tryptamine, their maximal effect being comparable to that of 5-HT; less agonist
        efficacy with m-trifluoro-phenyl-piperazine (TFMPP) (it inhibited at most 63% of
        stimulated cAMP formation); and antagonist activity against the 5-CT-mediated
        agonist response with methiothepin,
        2'-methyl-4-(5-methyl-(1,2,4)oxadiazol-3-yl)-biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid
        (4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-phenyl)-amide (GR 127,935), and
        ritanserin. Metergoline and 1-naphtylpiperazine showed different intrinsic
        activities. In contrast to their pronounced antagonist activity in the
        transfected CHO-K1 cell line, the antagonist effect was only partial and absent
        for metergoline and 1-naphtylpiperazine in the transfected C6-glial cell line,
        respectively. In conclusion, these cell lines are useful as a tool to measure
        with high sensitivity differences in intrinsic activities of 5-HT receptor
        ligands and, therefore, discriminate between silent antagonists (no intrinsic
        activity) and antagonists with intrinsic activity (i.e. partial agonists), even
        though this intrinsic activity may be relatively weak.<br>

        AB:  Bufotenine (N,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine) is a serotonin analog
        reported to be hallucinogenic. Bufotenine concentrations were measured by liquid
        chromatography with electrochemical detection after the s.c. injection of
        bufotenine (1, 30 or 100 mg/kg) into rats. At 1 hr, bufotenine was high in lung,
        heart and blood and lower in brain and liver. No
        N-monomethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine was detected, but 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
        (5HIAA) was increased due to bufotenine metabolism. Bufotenine disappeared
        nearly completely by 8 hr. Bufotenine concentrations were slightly higher in
        hypothalamus and brain stem than in striatum or cortex; serotonin was slightly
        decreased, and 5HIAA was increased in these brain regions. Pargyline reduced
        concentrations of 5HIAA in blood and tissues after bufotenine injection; LY51641
        but not deprenyl mimicked pargyline, suggesting type A not type B monoamine
        oxidase metabolizes bufotenine. Bufotenine injection increased serum
        corticosterone concentration, an effect not blocked by metergoline at a dose
        that blocked a similar increase elicited by quipazine. Although only 2% of the
        serotonin was found in platelet-poor plasma, more than 99% of the bufotenine was
        found in platelet-poor plasma, indicating that bufotenine is not stored in
        platelets. These experiments indicate that bufotenine is rapidly eliminated, in
        part by type A monoamine oxidase, after its injection into rats and that
        bufotenine penetrates the blood-brain barrier poorly.<br>

        AB:  The molecular processes by which agonists and antagonists bind to
        serotonin-2 (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT-2)) receptors are currently unknown.
        Three molecular models have proposed that conserved aromatic residues help to
        anchor the phenyl ring of 5-HT via stacking or pi-pi-type interactions with the
        5-HT-2 receptor. To test these models we made single point mutations (Phe-339
        fwdarw Leu-339 and Phe-340 fwdarw Leu-340) of two aromatic residues that are
        conserved among all guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled 5-HT receptors
        and a single point mutation (Phe-125 fwdarw Leu-125) that exchanges a 5-HT-2 for
        a 5-HT-1c sequence. (3H) Mesulergine binding was abolished by Phe-340 fwdarw
        Leu-340 and unchanged with the Phe-339 fwdarw Leu-339 and Phe-125 fwdarw Leu-125
        mutations, whereas (3-H)ketanserin binding affinity was diminished by the
        Phe-339 fwdarw Leu-339 mutation and unchanged by Phe-340 fwdarw Leu-340 and
        Phe-125 fwdarw Leu-125. We also found that the affinities of three ergot
        derivatives (mesulergine, methysergide, and lisuride) were decreased by
        88-1079-fold with only the Phe-340 fwdarw Leu-340 mutation. We also discovered
        that 4-(125I)iodo-2,5-(dimethoxy)phenylisopropylamine (DOI) binding was
        abolished in COS-7 cells expressing 5-HT-2 (Phe-340 fwdarw Leu-340) receptors
        but maintained in cells expressing the Phe-339 fwdarw Leu-339 and Phe-125 fwdarw
        Leu-125 mutations. Additionally, the K-i values for several agonists and partial
        agonists (5-HT, DOI, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine,
        bufotenine, and MK-212) were greatly diminished (26-14,000-fold decrease) only
        with the Phe-340 fwdarw Leu-340 receptor mutation. Finally, the Phe-340 fwdarw
        Leu-340 mutant receptors displayed an attenuated or abolished ability to augment
        phosphoinositide hydrolysis in COS-7 cells with four separate agonists (5-HT,
        MK-212, bufotenine, and quipazine). Taken together, these results are consistent
        with the idea that agonists and certain ergot derivatives anchor to 5-HT-2
        receptors, in part, via!<br>
         specific interactions with aromatic residue Phe-340 located in
        transmembrane region VI.<br>

        AB:  Bufotenine (BUTN) is a hallucinogen with psychotropic effects. High
        levels of BUTN and its precursor, N-methylserotonin are shown for the first time
        to occur and to accumulate mainly in the brain during the degradation of
        serotonin in the central nervous system of the toad, Bufo bufo japonicus. These
        compounds are concentrated in the hindbrain, which includes the cerebellum and
        medulla oblongata. BUTN can also be detected in blood and urine specimens from
        the toad. In humans, autism is a subtype of schizophrenia that appears to be a
        functional disease of the brain. BUTN can be detected in urine specimens from
        infant autistic patients. Analysis by three-dimensional HPLC suggests that the
        presence and levels of BUTN may be important markers for the diagnosis of
        autism. It appears, therefore, that some aspects of the central nervous system
        of Bufo may provide useful pharmacological clues to the etiology of human
        psychiatric diseases, such as autism, that are known to be linked to the
        methylation of serotonin.<br>

        AB:  During a recent evaluation of the abilities of 5HT-3 agents to
        modulate the release of (3H)-5HT from superfused rat spinal cord synaptosomes,
        bufotenine was found to be capable of increasing basal neurotransmitter efflux
        via a mechanism which was sensitive to blockade of the neuronal membrane
        transport carrier (Williams et al., 1992). The present study was undertaken to
        further characterize the action of bufotenine on 5HT neuronal function.
        Bufotenine-evoked release of (3H)-5HT was found to be unaltered by the removal
        of Ca++ from the superfusion media. In addition, using reserpine pre-treated
        tissues, it was determined that bufotenine releases 5HT primarily from
        extravesicular sites. A direct interaction of bufotenine with the neuronal
        membrane transport carrier is suggested by the ability of bufotenine to interact
        with sites labelled by (3H)-citalopram (K-i=356 +- 31 nM). A carrier mediated
        mechanism of release is further suggested by a comparable potency in the drug's
        ability to promote release (EC-50= 892 +- 60 nM). Bufotenine also weakly
        inhibited MAO activity. These results demonstrate that bufotenine has an action
        on 5HT neurons comparable to p-chloroamphetamine.<br>

        AB:  1. In order to explore whether 5-HT-4 receptor subtypes exist, we have
        characterized further the 5-HT-4 receptor that mediates tachycardia in the
        piglet isolated right atrium. All experiments were carried out in the presence
        of propranolol (400 nm) and cocaine (6 mu-M). We used tryptamine derivatives,
        substituted benzamides and benzimidazolone derivatives as pharmacological tools.
        2. Tachycardia responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were mimicked by other
        tryptamine derivatives with the following order of potency: 5-HT gt
        5-methoxytryptamine gt -alpha-methyl-5-HT = bufotenine gt
        5-carboxamidotryptamine = tryptamine (after treatment with pargyline) gt
        5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine gt 2-methyl-5-HT. 3. The substituted benzamides
        were all partial agonists relative to 5-HT except (-)-zacopride which was a full
        agonist. The stimulant potency order was renzapride gt cisapride = (-)-zacopride
        gt metoclopramide gt ( + )-zacopride. 4. The benzimidazolone derivatives had
        contrasting effects. BIMU 8
        (endo-N-(8-methyl-8azabicyclo(3.2.1)oct-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-(1-methyl(ethyl-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxamide
        hydrochloride) was a full agonist relative to 5-HT whilst BIMU 1
        (endo-N-(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo(3.2.1)oct-3-yl)2,3-dihydro-3-ethyl-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxamide
        hydrochloride) was a partial agonist with low intrinsic activity compared to
        5-HT but had similar potency. We estimated a pK-B of 7.9 for BIMU 1 antagonism
        of 5-HT-induced tachycardia. DAU 6215
        (N-endo-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo(3.2.1)-oct-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxamide,
        hydrochloride) had no chronotropic activity and was found to be a simple
        competitive antagonist with a pK-B of 7.1 5. SB 203186 (1-piperidinyl)ethyl
        1H-indole 3-carboxylate) was a potent antagonist with a pK-B of 8.3. The
        affinity of SB 203186 was approximately 20 times higher than that of tropisetron
        (ICS 205-930; pK-B = 6.9) and DAU 6215 (pK-B = 7.0). GR113808

        also antagonized 5-HT-induced tachycardia but not by simple competitive
        blockade. 6. The sinoatrial 5-HT-4 receptor in the piglet has a pharmacological
        profile that correlates well with 5-HT-4 receptors characterized in rat
        oesophagus, guinea-pig ileum and colon, mouse embryonic colliculi neurones and
        human atrium.<br>

        AB:  The activity of serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists, partial agonists
        and antagonists, and various other neurotransmitter receptor antagonists at
        human 5-HT-1A receptors that are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase in
        permanently transfected HeLa cells was investigated. 5-HT-1A receptor-mediated
        inhibition of adenylate cyclase was studied by measuring inhibition of cAMP
        accumulation, induced by forskolin. At 100 mu-M forskolin produced a 100-fold
        increase in cAMP formation: 5-HT concentration dependently inhibited the cAMP
        formation; maximal inhibition was attained at 1 mu-M 5-HT and represented 90% of
        the stimulated cAMP formation. Full inhibition was observed with 5-HT-1A
        receptor agonists: N,N-dipropyl-8-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin (5-OH-DPAT) and
        flesinoxan, and non-selective 5-HT receptor agonists: d-lysergic acid
        diethylamide (d-LSD), RU 24,969, bufotenine, methysergide and tryptamine. The
        rank order of potency of the compounds for inhibiting the cAMP formation
        corresponded to the rank order of the binding affinities of the drugs for the
        5-HT-1A receptor. Partial inhibition was obtained with submicromolar
        concentrations of buspirone, spiroxatrine and ipsapirone. A slight inhibition
        was observed with 1 mu-M 5-HT receptor agonist CP 93129 and 1 mu-M 5-HT receptor
        antagonists mesulergine and BW-501. No inhibition was found with: the 5-HT
        receptor agonists quipazine, sumatriptan and
        1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOM); the 5-HT receptor
        antagonist ICS-205,930; and other neurotransmitter receptor antagonists such as
        pindolol, CGP20712-A, prazosin, sulpiride and pyrilamine. Spiperone and pindolol
        fully antagonized the agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP
        formation. Partial inhibition of the agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated
        cAMP formation was apparent with 1 mu-M ocaperidone and 1 mu-M ipsapirone. It
        can be concluded that HeLa cells, permanently expressing human 5-HT-1A
        receptors, are a valid cellular system for studying the negative coupling of!<br>
         5-HT-1A receptors to adenylate cyclase and the action of compounds

        AB:  Monosynaptic connections between a giant serotonin-containing neurone
        and its serotonin-containing followers in the snail were studied in isolated
        preparations of the central nervous system. The presynaptic cell was the LP3
        cell in the left pedal ganglion and the followers were the RPa-s cells in the
        right parietal ganglion. The light microscopical morphology of the pre- and
        postsynaptic cells was investigated in whole-mount preparations following
        intracellular injection with a nickel-lysine complex. Axons from LP3 project
        towards the cerebral and suboesophageal ganglia or run in peripheral nerves
        which innervate feeding muscles and the foot. The follower neurones (RPa-s)
        project into nerves which innervate the heart and other visceral organs. The
        axons of LP3 and the RPa-s cells run in close proximity in the visceral ganglia.
        Ionophoretic application of serotonin onto the membrane of the postsynaptic RPa-s
        neurones mimicked the excitatory effect of the stimulation of the presynaptic
        LP3. Both the synaptic transmission between LP3 and its followers and the
        excitatory effect of exogenously applied serotonin on the RPa-s neurones
        decreased or were blocked in the presence of serotonin or the serotonin
        antagonists tryptamine, bufotenine, 7-methyltryptamine and MDL 72222-EFO2 in the
        bath. From this, we conclude that the excitatory neurotransmitter between LP3
        and followers is serotonin and not some other neurotransmitter which might
        coexist with serotonin in LP3. The serotonergic monosynaptic connections between
        LP3 and its right parietal followers may play a role in a variety of serotonin-mediated
        physiological and behavioural responses forming a link between feeding,
        locomotion and visceral functions.<br>

        or K+-evoked release of (3H) 5-HT from superfused synaptosomes from the spinal
        cord of the rat was investigated. Phenyl-biguanide did not alter the resting
        efflux of (3H)5-HIAA or (3H)5-HT or modify the K+-evoked release of (3H)5-HT.
        2-Methyl-5-HT (10 mu-M) caused an increase in resting efflux of (3H)5-HIAA, an
        effect that was blocked by the inhibitor of the uptake of 5-HT fluoxetine. No
        effect on K+-evoked release of tritium was observed. Bufotenine (100-1000 nM)
        increased the resting efflux of (3H)5-HT and (3H)5-HIAA. These effects were not
        antagonized by the 5-HT-3 antagonist ICS 205-930 but were antagonized by
        fluoxetine. The drug ICS 205-930 (1 mu-M) did not alter resting efflux or block
        the ability of serotonin (30 and 100 nM) to decrease K+-evoked release of
        tritium. Quipazine, a potent antagonist of peripheral 5-HT-3 receptors (subnanomolar
        concentrations), was also unable to alter resting or K+-evoked release of
        (3H)5-HT. It did, however, attenuate the inhibitory effect 5-HT on K+-evoked
        release. The concentrations required were in the micromolar range, consistent
        with the ability of the drug to antagonize the 5-HT-1B autoreceptor. These
        results support the idea that 5-HT-3 receptors do not act as nerve terminal
        autoreceptors in the spinal cord of the rat.<br>

        AB:  Desensitization of the contractile response mediated by the
        5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT-2) receptor in the isolated guinea-pig trachea and
        rabbit aorta is a time-dependent process and therefore it has been characterized
        by an apparent rate constant obtained from a kinetic analysis. Under similar
        conditions, desensitization of the response in the trachea is 7-fold faster than
        in the aorta. Desensitization is homologous and reversible and is not affected
        by inhibition of neuronal and extraneuronal uptake, monoamine oxidase activity,
        alpha-1 adrenergic, cholinergic muscarinic or histamine H-1 receptors.
        Desensitization does not depend on removal of epithelium from the trachea or
        endothelium and adventitia from the aorta or on the release of a stable relaxant
        factor. It is also not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca++, which is
        needed for tonic contraction. The dependence of desensitization on agonist
        concentration, number of receptors and the intrinsic activity of the agonist was
        determined. The observed values of the rate constants for desensitization and of
        the peak tension (T peak) in trachea show a saturable dependence on the
        concentration of 5-HT, indicating that occupancy of the 5-HT-2 receptor is
        needed for desensitization. The less efficacious agonists, N-methyl serotonin,
        dimethyltryptamine, quipazine, 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-methyltryptamine,
        5-methoxy dimethyltryptamine, 4-hydroxytryptamine and bufotenine induce
        significantly slower desensitization than 5-HT. A 25 to 75% reduction in 5-HT-2
        receptor number by alkylation had no effect on the observed rate constants for
        desensitization. This work demonstrates that desensitization of the 5-HT-2
        receptor is a time- and tissue-dependent process that depends on the occupancy
        of the receptor but does not depend on the number of receptors. Desensitization
        depends on intrinsic activity but a quantitative relationship between the
        observed rate constant for desensitization and intrinsic activity could not be
        clearly demonstrated.<br>

        5-carboxyamidotryptamine (5-CT), bufotenine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and
        tryptamine. These compounds have high affinity for 5-HT-1A and 5-HT-1D
        receptors. The 5-HT-1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin
        (8-OH-DPAT), the 5-HT-1C receptor agonist MK 212, and the mixed 5-HT-1C/5-HT-2
        receptor agonists (dl)-1-(2,5 dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and
        quipazine did not induce hindlimb scratching. Rather, the latter compounds
        attenuated 5-MeOT-induced hindlimb scratching. The 5-HT releasing compounds
        fenfluramine and p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) inhibited whereas the 5-HT re-uptake
        inhibitors fluvoxamine and indalpine potentiated 5-MeOT-induced hindlimb
        scratching. 5-MeOT-induced hindlimb scratching could be inhibited dose
        dependently by the alpha-2-adrenoceptor blockers yohimbine and rauwolsince,
        which also have high affinity for 5-HT-1D receptors, whereas the
        alpha-2-adrenoceptor blocker piperoxan only weakly counteracted hindlimb
        scratching. Haloperidol, apomorphine, clonidine and methiothepin strongly
        attenuated hindlimb scratching, atropine, naloxone and ICS 205930 attenuated it
        weakly whereas domperidone, methylatropine and mepyramine were inactive in doses
        up to 10 mg/kg. Hindlimb scratching induced by 5-MeOT was potentiated by the
        5-HT receptor antagonists metergoline, methylsergide, mesulergine, mianserin,
        ritanserin and xylamidine. Hindlimb scratching was not induced by i.c.v.
        injection of 5-MeOT. This lack of i.c.v. activity of 5-MeOT and the effect of
        xylamidine suggests that the site of action for induction of hindlimb scratching

        AB:  The affinites of several 5-hydroxy-indole derivatives for serotonin-1
        (5-HT-1) binding site subtypes, labeled with 2 nM (3H)5-HT, were assessed by
        quantitative autoradiography on rat brain sections. The results obtained with
        known ligands, namely 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-methoxytryptamine (5-Me-OT),
        5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine (5-Me-ODMT), 5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine
        (bufotenine) and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) demonstrate
        the reliability and the advantages of this technique for pharmacological
        studies. Novel serotonin derivatives were synthesized by carboxymethylation of
        the hydroxyl group. One of those new ligands,
        serotonin-O-carboxy-methyl-glycyl-tyrosinamide (S-CM-GTNH-2), inhibited 2 nM
        (3H)5-HT binding to the substantia nigra with an IC-50 of 22.4 nM, a value which
        is 22 times lower than that found in the dentate gyrus and choroid plexus. This
        demonstrates the preferential affinity of S-CM-GTNH-2 for 5-HT-1B versus 5-HT-1A
        and 5-HT-1C binding sites. S-CM-GTNH-2 contains a tyrosine residue, which may be
        useful for the synthesis of a radioactive iodinated molecule and for the
        preparation of'long-lasting lignands' linked through peptide bonds with a
        protein. These derivatives could be of great interest for ultrastructural and
        behavioral studies relevant to 5-HT-1B sites.<br>

        AB:  Affinities of drugs for 21 indolealkylamine derivatives, some with
        putative hallucinogenic activity, were determined at 5-HT-1A, 5-HT-2A and
        5-HT-2B recognition sites, using radioligand competition studies. Nearly all of
        the derivatives displayed greatest potency for the 5-HT-2A receptor, labelled by
        (125I)R-(-)DOI in the cortex of the rat. MOst derivatives displayed 2-10 times
        lower affinity at the HT-2B receptor labelled by (3H)ketanserin in bovine
        cortex. Derivatives lacking ring substituents displayed lower affinities for all
        of the recognition sites, compared to derivatives substituted in the 4- or
        5-position of the indole ring. The 4-hydroxylated derivatives displayed
        25-380-fold selectivity for the 5-HT-2A site, vs the 5-HT-1A site, while the
        5-substituted derivatives displayed approximately equal potency at the 5-HT-1A
        and 5-HT-2A sites. Affinity of all the compounds at the 5-HT-2B site was greater
        than 300 nM. The 6-substitued derivatives displayed greater than micromolar
        affinities for all of the 5-HT recognition sites examined. The size of the
        N,N-dialkyl substituent was a secondary determinant of affinity, with groups
        larger than N,N-diisopropyl resulting in a marked reduction in affinity at both
        the 5-HT-2A and 5-HT-1A recognition sites. This study demonstrated that
        hallucinogenic 4-hydroxy-indolealkylamines, like psychotomimetic
        phenylisopropylamines, bind potently and selectively to the 5-HT-2A recognition
        site, labelled by (125I)R-(-)DOI. This provides further evidence indicating that
        this recently described subtype of the 5-HT-2 receptor may partially mediate the
        action of hallucinogenic agents.<br>

        endothelium-dependent relaxation of pig coronary arteries was characterized
        using a variety of 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists. Unrubbed (with
        endothelium preserved) rings precontracted by prostaglandin F-2alpha in the
        presence of ketanserin relaxed in an endothelium-dependent manner to 5-HT,
        5-carboxamidotryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine with about equal potency and
        efficacy. By comparison, bufotenine,
        3-(dimethylamino)ethyl-N-methyl-1H-indole-5-methane sulfonamide,
        (-)-alpha-methyl-5-HT, N,N-dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine and
        5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H indole were half-efficient and
        other drugs (in particular the 5-HT-1A receptor agonist
        8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) were inactive as agonists up to 0.1 mM.
        The effect of 5-carboxamidotryptamine was antagonized in an apparently
        competitive manner by 15 drugs. Among the most potent antagonists (mean pK-B
        value) were the nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonists, methiothepin (7.30) and
        metergoline (6.86), the 5-HT-1A/5-HT-1D receptor ligand,
        1-(2-(4-amino-phenyl)ethyl)-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine (7.02), the
        5-HT-1A/5-HT-1B/5-HT-1D receptor ligand,
        7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrrolo(1,2,-a)quinoxaline 1 (6.73)
        and yohimbine (6.37). Selective ligands for 5-HT-1A receptors were either
        inactive (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide) or poorly active
        (spiperone, 4.44). Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with affinity for 5-HT-1A and
        5-HT-1B receptors weakly antagonized the effect of 5-carboxamidotryptamine (pK-B
        values ltoreq 5.32), as did the 5-HT-1C/5-HT-2 receptor antagonist, mesulergine
        (5.30) and the yohimbine isomer, corynanthine (4.85). Methysergide was clearly a
        noncompetitive antagonist. Antagonist pK-B values correlated well (r = 0.81, P =
        0.001) and exclusively with pK-D values at the 5-HT-1D binding site. It is
        concluded that the 5-HT receptor mediating endothelium-dependent relaxation of
        pig coronary arteries shares !<br>
        similarities with the 5-HT-1D receptor subtype.<br>

        AB:  We have assayed several phenylalkylamine and indolealkylamine
        hallucinogens, as well as structurally similar nonhallucinogens, for their
        effect on human platelet shape change, a physiological model for the central
        serotonergic 5-HT-2 receptor. The hallucinogenic drugs lysergic acid
        diethylamide (LSD-25), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT),
        5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT),
        4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine (DOI), bufotenine, and mescaline all
        showed a characteristic 5-HT-2 partial agonist effect on platelet shape change.
        Nonhallucinogens with structural similarity to hallucinogens did not share this
        profile. Lisuride, methysergide, and lysergic acid showed antagonism of
        5-HT-induced shape change, but none were shape change agonists. Other
        &quot;psychoactive&quot; or mood-altering drugs (cocaine, amphetamine,
        phencylidine) showed poor antagonism of 5-HT-induced platelet shape change. This
        work refines recent ideas that some of the behavioral effects of LSD-type
        hallucinogens in humans are due to their actions at 5-HT-2 receptors and
        suggests that these hallucinogens are partial 5-HT-2 agonists.<br>

        production in a pig choroid plexus preparation. This effect has been
        pharmacologically characterized and the data compared to those obtained from
        radioligand binding studies performed with (3H)mesulergine to 5-HT-1C sites in
        pig choroid plexus membranes. 2) The rank order of potency of agonists
        stimulating inositol phosphate production was: alpha-methyl-5-HT gt
        1-methyl-5-HT gt DOI gt bufotenine = SKF 83566 = 5-HT gt 5-MeO-DMT gt 5-MeOT =
        RU 24969 gt SCH 23390 gt 5-CT. 8-OH-DPAT was virtually devoid of activity at 100
        mu-ol/l. 3) The increase in inositol phosphate production induced by 5-HT and
        other agonists was surmountably antagonised by mesulergine, ketanserin and
        spiperone with pK-B values of 8.7, 6.7 and 5.3, respectively. 4) The rank order
        of potency of antagonists was: metergoline gt mesulergine gt LY 53857 gt
        ritanserin gt methiothepin gt mianserin gt cyproheptadine gt pirenperone gt
        cinanserin gt ketanserin gt spiperone. The following antagonists were virtually
        devoid of activity at 100 mu-mol/l; pindolol, 21-009 and yohimbine. 5) The
        results obtained both with agonists and antagonists strongly support the view
        that 5-HT 1C receptors mediate agonist induced production of inositol phosphates
        in pig choroid plexus. This is illustrated by the close similarity between
        5-HT-1C binding and stimulation of inositol phospholipid turnover in this
        preparation. 6) The present data also show that compounds believed to be
        selective for dopamine D1 receptors (SKF 83566, SCH 23390) or 5-HT-2 receptors (DOI,
        alpha-methyl-5-HT, LY 53857, ritanserin, cyproheptadine) also interact with
        5-HT-1C receptors. 7) A case can be made for the 5-HT-1C receptor, with its
        similarities to the 5-HT-2 receptor in terms of pharmacology and second
        messenger coupling, being a 5-HT-2 receptor subtype.<br>

        AB:  To determine if serotonin may be involved in associative
        conditioning-produced changes in the excitability and photoresponses of Type B
        photoreceptors, isolated nervous systems were exposed to an in vitro
        conditioning procedure (16, 19, 27) in the presence or absence of drugs that
        alter normal serotonergic neurotransmission. Pairings of light and intracellular
        depolarization of a caudal hair cell (in vitro conditioning) produced a
        pairing-specific depolarization of Type B photoreceptors that was accompanied by
        an increase in resting input resistance. Treatment of nervous systems with
        pharmacological agents which disrupt 5-HT neurotransmission attenuated membrane
        potential and input resistance changes of Type B photoreceptors. These drugs
        included serotonin uptake inhibitors (imipramine, fluoxetine), a receptor
        antagonist (bufotenine), and a neurotoxin (5,7-dihydroxytryptamine; 5,7-DHT).
        Yohimbine, an alpha-2-receptor antagonist, was without effect. These results,
        and those in the accompanying papers (9,22), suggest that serotonin modulates
        Type B photoreceptor excitability during associative conditioning.<br>

        stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in mouse embryo colliculi neurons in
        primary culture. The pharmacological profile characterized with agonists and
        antagonists suggests that this 5-HT receptor does not appear to correspond to a
        known 5-HT receptor. On this 5-HT receptor, 5-HT (EC-50 = 109 +- 17 nM) and
        5-methoxytryptamine (5MeOT) were equipotent agonists. The other tryptamine
        derivatives, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine
        (5-MeOT-N,N-DMT), were full potent agonists, whereas tryptamine, bufotenine, and
        2-CH-3-5-HT were weak partial agonists. Two selective 5-HT-1A agonists:
        8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and ipsapirone, could not
        stimulate adenylate cyclase. RU 24969, a tetrahydropyridoindole derivative that
        is a potent 5-HT-1A and 5-HT-1B agonist was also inactive, whereas RU 28253,
        another member of this series, could stimulate cAMP production. The action of

        (-)-pindolol (5-HT-1B), mesulergine (5-HT-1C), and ketanserin (5-HT-2), were
        almost inactive in reversing the 5-HT stimulating effect. The selective 5-HT-3
        antagonist ICS 205 930 was a full competitive antagonist at this receptor.
        Nevertheless, MDL 72222, which is also a 5-HT-3 antagonist, was very weak in
        antagonizing the 5-HT stimulatory effect. A receptor with similar
        characteristics has also been found in guinea pig hippocampal membranes. In
        these membranes, the second receptor of low affinity for 5-HT, termed R-L, which
        is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase, was also antagonized by ICS 205 930.
        The relatively low affinity of this hippocampal receptor for 5-CT, its
        stimulation by RU 28253 but not by RU 24969, and its previously reported
        pharmacological characteristics support the contention that this 5-HT receptor
        and the 5-HT receptor of mouse embryo collic!<br>
        uli neurons in primary culture (both positively coupled to cAMP formation)
        present great homologies. Inasmuch as none of the classical specific 5-HT-1 and
        5-HT-2 agonists or antagonists interact with these 5-HT receptors, it is
        unlikely that they belong to 5-HT-1 or 5-HT-2 receptor categories. Furthermore,
        inasmuch as only one 5-HT-3 antagonist (ICS 205 930) blocks their activity and
        another 5-HT-3 agonist (MDL 72222), as well as the specific 5-HT-3 agonist
        2-CH-3-5-HT, were almost inactive, the possibility that they belong to the
        5-HT-3 category is excluded. We propose that the 5-HT receptor of mouse embryo
        colliculi neurons, as well as the low affinity 5-HT receptor (R-L) of the guinea
        pig hippocampus, belong to a new category of 5-HT receptors that we suggest
        calling 5-HT-4.<br>

        AB:  Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) inhibited the formation of cAMP
        promoted by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, plus forskolin, in mouse
        hippocampal and cortical neurons in primary culture. The rank order of potencies
        of classical 5-HT-1 agonists in inhibiting cAMP formation in hippocampal neurons
        was 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) gt
        5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) gt d-lysergic acid diethylamide gt 5-HT gt
        5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-N,N-DMT) gt RU 24969 gt ipsapirone gt
        bufotenine gt buspirone (half-maximal efficacy (EC-50) = 7, 18, 30, 52, 90, 102,
        100, 110, and 128 nM, respectively). All the tryptamine derivatives substituted
        in position 5 of the indol were potent agonists (5-HT, 5-CT, 5-MeO-N,N-DMT,
        5-methoxytryptamine, and bufotenine), whereas tryptamine, N-methyltryptamine,
        and N,N-dimethyltryptamine were poor agonists. The most potent antagonists
        tested were spiperone, (+-)-pindolol, (+-)-cyanopindolol, WB4101, and
        methiothepin, the affinity of spiperone for this receptor being 22 nM. In
        contrast, ketanserin, a specific 5-HT-2 antagonist, and 5-HT-3-selective drugs
        (ICS 205 930 and MDL 72222) were very weak in antagonizing the 5-HT-inhibited
        cAMP formation. The pharmacological profiles of 5-HT receptors mediating the
        inhibition of cAMP formation indicate that these receptors correspond to the
        5-HT-1A-binding site subtypes. Experiments with the Bordetella pertussis toxin
        indicate that the 5-HT-1A receptor mediating inhibition of cAMP production
        involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. In the absence of VIP,
        cAMP formation could be stimulated through a 5-HT receptor, but the specific
        5-HT-1A agonists, 8-OH-DPAT and RU 24969 did not stimulate cAMP production.
        These results suggest that in mouse embryonic hippocampal neurons, the 5-HT-1A
        receptors, which are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, are distinct from
        the receptor positively coupled to this enzyme. The pharmacological
        characterization of the 5-HT receptor negatively coupled to !<br>
        adenylate cyclase in mouse embryonic cortical neurons indicates that it differs
        from the 5-HT-1A receptor found in hippocampal neurons. Its main differences
        with the 5-HT-1A receptor in hippocampal neurons are as follows: 8-OH-DPAT was
        only a poor partial agonist in cortical neurons, whereas it was the best full
        agonist in hippocampal neurons; and metergoline and methysergide as well as the
        anxiolytic drugs, ipsapirone and buspirone, which were potent agonists in
        hippocampal neurons, were competitive antagonists in cortical neurons. Since
        5-HT receptors inhibiting cAMP formation in embryonic cortical neurons share
        many other pharmacological characteristics with a typical 5-HT-1A receptor, we
        can conclude that it is likely to be a nontypical 5-HT-1A receptor.<br>

        AB:  Two 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors mediate stimulation of
        adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of adult guinea pig hippocampus. The two
        receptors were characterized with agonists and antagonists and with the aid of
        computerized curve-fitting procedures. Each receptor mediates about 50% of the
        maximal response to 5-HT. 5-HT is about 10-fold more potent in eliciting
        response through one cyclase-linked receptor (R-H) than the other (R-L). The
        concentrations of 5-HT that elicit half-maximal response through R-H and R-L are
        43 +- 6 nM and 414 +- 53 nm, respectively. 5-Methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT) and 5-HT
        are approximately equipotent at each receptor. The agonists tryptamine and
        bufotenine are less potent than 5-HT at both receptors, and each is about
        50-fold selective for R-H. The two receptors are best discriminated by the
        agonists 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CONH-2-T) and
        8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), both of which are selective
        for R-H. 5-CONH-2-T is about 7-fold more potent than 5-HT at R-H. The rank order
        of agonist potencies at R-H (5-CONH-2-T gt 8-OH-DPAT = 5-HT = 5-MeOT gt
        bufotenine gt tryptamine) differs from that at R-L (5-HT = 5-MeOT gt bufotenine
        gt tryptamine = 5-CONH-2-T gt 8-OH-DPAT). Spiperone acts as a simple competitive
        antagonist at R-H, with a dissociation constant of 20 nM, but it is at least
        100-fold less potent as an antagonist at R-L. The relatively low affinities of
        the selective 5-HT antagonists ketanserin and MDL 72222 for R-H and R-L indicate
        that neither receptor may be classified as the 5-HT-2 or as the 5-HT-3 (i.e.,
        peripheral neuronal) type. The characteristics of R-H suggest that it is a
        functional correlate of the 5-HT-1A-binding site in brain. R-L appears not to
        correspond to a known 5-HT-binding site, but it may be homologous to receptors
        that mediate 5-HT-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in other systems such as
        infant rat colliculi. R-H and R-L may also mediate stimulation of adenylate
        cyclase activity by 5-HT in hippocampal membran!<br>

        containing 1 mM 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) or 5 mM Co-2+ accumulate cyclic
        AMP (cAMP). A portion of this pool is light sensitive, as light can prevent or
        reverse its accumulation. Similarly, tryptamine, serotonin, 5-methoxytryptamine,
        bufotenine, and 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine can block the accumulation of the
        light sensitive pool of cAMP, whereas tryptophan, melatonin, N-acetylserotonin,
        5-methoxytryptophol, and tetrahydro-beta-carbolines are inactive. The phenomenon
        is not seen with mutant mouse retinas (rd/rd), which lack most photoreceptors,
        but persists in abnormal retinas containing photoreceptors but with extensive
        neuronal depletion in the inner retina. Tryptamine also inhibits cAMP
        accumulation in either dark or light-adapted retinas exposed to forskolin alone
        but not in media containing high levels of forskolin plus 1 mM IBMX. There is
        some suggestion that serotonin 5-HT antagonists can partially reverse the action
        of the tryptamines, but hitherto undescribed receptors may be involved. Current
        data suggest that photoreceptors are the target for the action of the
        tryptamines.<br>

        AB:  TVX Q 7821 is active in several behavioral models of anxiety in
        animals and has a high selective affinity for brain serotonin 5-HT-1A receptors
        in binding assays. In order to determine if interaction with 5-HT-1A receptors
        is important for some of the behavioral effects of this compound, 11 rats were
        trained to reliably discriminate the interoceptive stimuli induced by TVX Q 7821
        (10 mg/kg, IP) from those of saline. Following discrimination acquisition TVX Q
        7821 administration resulted in drug-appropriate responding with an ED-50 of 1.5
        mg/kg, as did other substances with high affinity for the 5-HT-1A receptor:
        8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, ED-50 = 0.16 mg/kg),
        5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-OMe-DMT, ED-50 = 2.5 mg/kg), buspirone
        (ED-50 = 5.4 mg/kg). Anxiolytics not acting via the 5-HT-1A receptor, like
        diazepam and pentobarbital, did not induce full TVX Q 7821-appropriate
        responses. In addition non-selective 5-HT agonist and antagonists such as
        bufotenin, quipazine, and methysergide, as well as substances with high affinity
        for the 5-HT-1B receptor (m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine, TFMPP;
        5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)-1H-indole succinate, RU 24969) did
        not substitute for TVX Q 7821. These data support a selective 5-HT-1a mechanism
        of action in vivo for TVX Q 7821 and indicate the suitability of TVX Q 7821 for
        the investigation of behavioral correlates of the 5-HT-1A receptor.<br>

        AB:  The binding of (3H)5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) to cellular
        membranes was examined after preincubation of (3H)5-HT in the presence or
        absence of ascorbate. The tissue preparation was identical in all experiments
        and consisted of rat cerebellular homogenates in Tris-HCl buffer with 0.1%
        ascorbate. Cerebellar membranes were used because of their low density of
        5-HT-1, binding sites. In the presence of ascorbate during a 4-h preincubation
        period, minimal specific binding of 2 nM (3H)5-HT is detected. Similar results
        are obtained with equimolar concentrations of other antioxidants (butylated
        hydroxytoluene, sodium dithionite, and sodium metabisulfite). Apparent specific
        binding increased 14-fold following a 4-h preincubation of (3H)-5-HT in the
        absence of ascorbate. The increase in apparent specific (3H)5-HT binding is
        time-dependent and plateaus after 4-6 h of preincubation. When ascorbate is
        present during the 4-h preincubation, Scathcard analysis of (3H)5-HT binding
        reveals a K-D value of 3.0 +- 0.3 nM and a B-max value of 1.9 +- 0.2 pmol/g
        tissue. When ascorbate is absent during the preincubation, the K-D is
        essentially unchanged at 3.6 +- 0.1 nM but the B-max is significantly increased
        to 36.5 +- 7 pmol/g tissue. Drug competition studies reveal that the apparent
        specific &quot;(3H)5-HT binding&quot; in the absence of ascorbate appears to be
        displaced by nanomolar concentrations of hydroxylated tryptamines (5-HT,
        bufotenine) but not by nonhydroxylated tryptamines (5-methoxytryptamine,
        tryptamine). HPLC analysis demonstrates that (3H)5-HT is essentially destroyed
        by a 4-h incubation of 22 degree C in the absence of ascorbate. We conclude that
        oxidation of (3H)5-HT prior to the addition of membrane homogenates leads to the
        detection of an artifactual high-affinity and saturable &quot;(3H)5-HT binding
        site&quot; that appears to have a distinct pharmacological profile. The capacity
        of other ligands to compete for this binding site is related to their potential
        as antioxidants and not to their affinity for a novel !<br>

        AB:  The present study was performed to examine the central effects of the
        indolealkylamine hallucinogens, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (MDMT),
        bufotenin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), infused intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)
        into the lateral ventricle. They were found to have a stimulatory effect upon
        the secretion of prolactin. Their order of potency was compared. From a
        structure-activity point of view, MDMT is the most potent, followed by bufotenin,
        and then by DMT. Bufotenin, which does not readily cross the blood-brain
        barrier, caused a prolonged effect on the elevation of prolactin, with a
        suggestion of a biphasic effect at the maximum dose (0.02 M).
        N,N-dimethyltryptamine showed a clear dose-response relationship in the
        stimulation of the release of prolactin. The present results confirm those of
        previous investigators, who have demonstrated that these drugs cause the release
        of prolactin, with a possible biphasic effect. The present results suggest that,
        the response which was obtained was centrally mediated, and probably did not
        involve stimulation of peripheral receptors and the time course of action of
        indoles is different when infused centrally, compared to their time course when
        infused peripherally.<br>

        with a physiological buffer, and stimulated by perfusion with a K+-enriched
        buffer for 2 min. The tritium overflow evoked by K+ was decreased by
        5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) (maximal inhibition 10-6 M). This effect
        of 5-HT was mimicked by several agonists (5-methoxytryptamine,
        N,N-dimethyltryptamine, bufotenin) and blocked by serotonergic antagonists (methiothepin,
        methysergide, cinanserin) but not by haloperidol; methiothepin and methysergide
        alone slightly increased the K+-evoked overflow of tritium (3H). Inhibition of
        the tritium release by 5-HT was not suppressed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX)
        (10-6 M). These results suggest that 5-HT tonically inhibits acetylcholine (ACh)
        release from striatal cholinergic neurons by acting on a presynaptic receptor
        localized on cholinergic terminals.<br>

        AB:  Two different classes of binding sites probably related to
        serotonergic receptors have already been reported: 5-HT-1 binding sites
        recognize (3H)5-hydroxytryptamine with a high affinity (K-d = 3 nM) and S-2
        binding sites recognize (3H)spiroperidol and (3H)ketanserine. An additional
        population of sites has been observed in crude membrane preparations or
        fractions enriched with synaptosomal membranes obtained from rat brain cortex.
        This population was observed as a single class of sites in a synaptosomal
        fraction (L fraction-according to Laduron (1977)). It corresponded to a
        dissociation constant K-d = 13-15 nM, and B-max = 0.80 +- 0.15 pmol/mg protein.
        Displacement experiments showed that it recognized preferentially the 5-HT
        structure (bufotenin, 5-MeO-tryptamine). Tryptamine was a weak displacer and
        5,7-dihydroxytryptamine totally inefficient. Neither 8-OH-DPAT, nor quipazine
        had any effect. Methiothepin, cinanserin and cyproheptadine displaced 5-HT from
        these sites whereas ergot derivatives did not. Contrary to 5-HT-1 binding, this
        recently observed binding was not altered by GTP; alpha-MSH reduced the
        corresponding B-max whereas Leu-enkephalin did not. The degenerative lesion of
        the serotonergic fibers led to a slight increase in the B-max of the binding
        without altering the K-d which means that corresponding sites are not located on
        serotonergic fibers and might be postsynaptically located.<br>

        AB:  The 5-HT-2 (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor in isolated rabbit thoracic
        aorta was characterized by examining the relationships between structure and
        activity of 9 tryptamine analogs. All assays were conducted after blockade of
        the alpha-adrenergic receptor and inactivation of the neuronal uptake-1 system
        and monoamine oxidase. Seven of the analogs tested were agonists.
        6-Hydroxytryptamine and 7-hydroxytryptamine showed little or no agonist activity
        in this preparation. The pA-2 (partial antagonism) of spiperone was independent
        of the agonist assayed and defined the receptor activated by each agonist as the
        5-HT-2 receptor. The dissociation constant (K-A) and relative intrinsic efficacy
        were determined for each agonist. The K-A and relative intrinsic efficacy values
        for 5-hydroxytryptamine were 0.25 muM and 1, respectively. The K-A and relative
        intrinsic efficacy values for 5-methoxytryptamine were 0.14 muM and 0.86,
        respectively, and were not significantly different from those for
        5-hydroxytryptamine. The other 5 analogs were partial agonists.
        N-Methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine and bufotenine had relative intrinsic efficacies of
        about 0.3 and K-A values not statistically different from the K-A value for
        5-hydroxytryptamine. Tryptamine, 5-methyltryptamine and alpha-methyl-tryptamine
        had K-A values of about 1 muM and relatie intrinsic efficacies of 0.6, 0.6 and
        0.4, respectively. The differential effects of structural changes on drug
        affinity and intrinsic efficacy were illustrated. This information will be
        applicable in the design of selective agonists or antagonists for the
        classification of less well defined 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors.<br>

        brain and body weights of hypotrophic offspring significantly lower than those
        of pair-aged control rats, even after 6 wk of postnatal rearing under normal
        conditions. In vitro measurements in homogenates indicated that Na+/K+-ATPase in
        the forebrain, cerebellum and hippocampus was less active in hypotrophic rats
        than in pair-aged controls for at least the 1st mo. after birth. 5-HT
        (5-hydroxytryptamine) and related agonists (RU-24969
        (5-methoxy-3-(1,2-3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-IH-indolesuccinate), butotenine
        and to a lower extent, tryptamine) stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase activity more
        efficiently in tissues from hypotrophic rats than in those from control animals.
        Opposite changes were noted in the brain stem: basal Na+/K+-ATPase activity was
        higher in hypotrophic rats during the 2nd half of the 1st postnatal month but
        the stimulatory effect of 5-HT was lower than in pair-aged control animals.
        Since potent 5-HT antagonists such as cinanserin, methiothepin and methysergide,
        prevented the 5-HT induced-activation of Na+/K+-ATPase in brain homogenates,
        these results are discussed in relation with the possible existence of a
        specific 5-HT receptor controlling Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the rat brain.<br>

        AB:  Many radiolabeled receptors coupled to intracellular adenylate cyclase
        activity are modulated by physiological modulators such as GTP and Gpp(NH)p (guanosine
        imidodiphosphate). The apparent affinity of agonists competing for the binding
        of 3H-antagonist-labeled receptors is reduced in the presence of GTP and
        Gpp(NH)p. The agonist-specific effects of GTP and Gpp(NH)p on rat brain cortical
        S-2 serotonin receptors are reported. The agonists serotonin,
        5-methoxytryptamine, bufotenine and tryptamine display 3-fold lower affinities
        for S-2 serotonin receptors in the presence of 10-4 M GTP or Gpp(NH)p than in
        the absence of the nucleotides. The antagonists spiperone, cinanserin,
        cyproheptadine and methysergide are unaffected by the guanine nucleotides. The
        Hill coefficients of the agonists increase from between 0.70-0.80 to 0.90-1.00
        due to guanine nucleotides. ATP, ADP and GDP have little or no effect. This
        pattern of guanine nucleotide effects was found with receptors which are
        modulated by a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and may indicate that the
        S-2 serotonin receptor may be coupled to intracellular adenylate cyclase
        activity.<br>

        antagonists tested for potency and selectivity. Selective blockade of 5-HT
        responses was produced by 5-HT itself and, in increasing order of potency, by
        cocaine, metoclopramide and quipazine. A non-selective blockade was observed
        with bufotenine and d-tubocurarine. Substances which had no effect on 5-HT
        responses included methysergide and other compounds related to LSD, cinanserin,
        cyproheptadine, phenylbiguanide and morphine. The results provide further
        information about the 5-HT receptor on sympathetic ganglion cells. This receptor
        evidently is distinct from neuronal receptors in the myenteric plexus and on
        cholinergic nerve terminals.<br>
