        <br>
        Doing a bit of research in various <a href="news:alt.drugs">alt.drugs</a> files, and some textbooks I discovered
        that Bufo
        alvarius (Sonoran Desert or Colorado River Toad) has a venom in its parotoid gland that contains from
        <a href="erspamer.html#erspamer1"> 6-16% of 5-MeO DMT</a>. Having experienced this (or a related) drugs once
        before, I was exited at the chance of obtaining a readily available supply of it.<br>
        <br>
        After consulting with the local herpetologist, and checking with several biological supply houses, I discovered
        that B.
        alvarius is a common enough toad, but not available this time of the year. The price for a B.
        alvarius is generally around $10 plus $25 (US) for shipping.<br>
        <br>
        Luckily for me, the local pet-shop had three specimens. Since they were rather exorbitantly priced, I decided to
        have a go at conning them out of some venom. I used the story that I was a biochemistry student interested in
        certain indole alkaloids present in the venom of Bufo
        alvarius . Basically, I told them the truth. After checking with the management, they gave me the go ahead.<br>
        <br>
        Extracting the venom was somewhat problematic. <a href="bibliography.html#venom"> Venomous Animals and their
            Venoms</a> gives a procedure where the toad is pressed firmly down with one hand and the
        parotoid gland (behind the "ear") is squeezed firmly with the other. A piece of glass is suspended above the
        toad to catch the viscous venom as it squirts from the toad. I found this method awkward. The best way (after
        brief experimentation) I was able to discover was to hold the toad in one hand, squeeze the gland with the
        other, and have an assistant hold some glass in the firing line of the
        parotoid gland. This should be repeated once after the toad is allowed to rest for 20 minutes or
        so [actually 30-40 minutes]. You must apply a considerable amount of pressure to release any poison; I was
        hesitant in this as I was afraid I would injure the toads (especially with the manager standing next to me).
        Because I didn't apply as much pressure as I should have, I only obtained 80-100 mg of venom from the three
        toads. According to
        <a href="bibliography.html#venom"> Venomous Animals and their Venoms</a> I should have obtained something
        more like 400mg per toad.<br>
        <br>
        In any case, after letting the poison dry, I scraped it off the glass, obtaining a fine
        crystalline substance. I took 1 gram of Harmala seeds for my experiment (I weigh 160 lbs) and a
        friend (who weighs 260) took 1.7 grams of the same substance. We also smoked one MJ
        cigarette. Instead of freebasing the 5-MeO-DMT (as would have been most efficient) we mixed it with some MJ and
        smoked it in a pipe. The taste was unusual, but not intensely unpleasant.
        Halfway through smoking the quantity, we stopped. I noticed an odd feeling and slight buzz from the MJ, the
        friend noticed nothing. We continued smoking, and after finishing both noticed some rather extreme effects.<br>
        <br>
        Objects appeared extremely distorted, colors were intensified and facial quirks were magnified, giving people a
        clown-like appearance. Perception of distance was extremely
        distorted; objects within arms reach seemed miles away. Height perceptions were also distorted, one minute I
        seemed like a giant compared to those around me, the next minute I seemed a dwarf in comparison. Light sources
        provoked an unusual reaction; they seemed surrounded by moving, prismatic colors. Walking was problematic; the
        sidewalk reminded me of the famous films of the "galloping gertie" bridge in
        Washington state. I felt as if I was surfing rather than walking. Observations of the facial expressions of the
        passersby seemed to indicate that my manner of walking was no different than that of any of the other
        pedestrians that night. My
        friend (who was, for the record, rather out of shape) claimed to experience racing heart, but I had no such
        difficulties.<br>
        <br>
        After walking for approximately 15 minutes, the intensity of the experience subsided, and we felt able to go to
        the bar as we had intended. We were both rather strongly intoxicated for the next hour, drinking several beers
        in that time. Paranoiac feelings, and some mild visual/auditory hallucinations persisted for approximately 2
        hours after taking the substance.<br>
        <br>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        Conclusion: the venom of B. alvarius seems to contain the quantities of
        5-MeO-DMT that are claimed for it in the various publications. Its use with harmaline seemed to powerfully
        increase the already present marijuana intoxication (unlike LSD, which often has an antagonistic effect with
        THC), as well as provoking uniquely powerful visual hallucinations. The steroidal poisons in the venom may have
        a toxic cardiac effect when the venom is smoked, or (more likely IMHO, due to my lack of similar reaction) the
        heart-racing may have been due to the effects of the THC intoxication, or the effects of the 5-MeO-DMT itself.
        It would
        probably be a very bad idea to ingest this substance orally in conjunction with harmaline as a kind of animal
        ayahuasca; the steroidal poisons are doubtless much more harmful when an orally active dose is taken, due both
        to the greater quantity that would be required, and to the lack of steroid pyrolysis in an oral dose.<br>

    Further experiments will be undertaken under different, more controlled circumstances.<br>

    >the skins of dried Bufo Americanus skins?<br>
    <br>
    Absolutely none; you want Bufo alvarius -not americanus.
    According to &quot;<a href="bibliography.html#venom">Venomous Animals and Their
        Venoms</a>&quot; (highly recommended), the venom (from B alvarius) contains <a
        href="erspamer.html#erspamer1"> 6-16%
        5-MeO-DMT</a>- the rest is mostly mucus. [Wrong] As for the whole skin; <a href="almost.html#goose"> why
        kill the toad when you can milk it for its venom?</a> I recall the skin percentage to be something like 0.3-0.1%
    by weight (since this probably includes the venom glands, it really isn't much). Americanus skin has mostly
    bufotenine which has never been shown to be psychedelic below toxic doses. It also contains some adrenal poisons.
    Bad idea. Leave them poor little froggies alone!<br>
    <br>
    &gt;<a href="5meo.html#dose">How much would one have to smoke</a> to<br>
    >get the "effects"?<br>
    <br>
    An active dose is 2-5 milligrams. You do the math.<br>
    <br>
    >Must it be freebased (i.e. smoked in a "crack pipe"), or<br>
    >can it be mixed in with a little MJ and smoked through a pipe?<br>
    <br>
    Either way will work, but <a href="pipe.html"> freebasing is much more
        efficient</a>. More will be pyrolized if you mix the stuff with a burning substance.<br>
    <br>
    >Has anyone had<br>
    >any experience with the skins sold from JLF?<br>
    <br>
    What the heck would you do with those? Those are not Bufo alvarius, and hence contain NO 5-MeO-DMT. All they have
    are bufotenine and steroidal poisons related to
    adrenaline. Yukky stuff; the Bufo marinus skin is potentially lethal (this is the stuff that young punks in
    California are licking &amp; getting sick from. According to a herpetologist I know, B.
    marinus is a controlled substance in Callie.)<br>
    <br>
    You want some Bufo alvarius; Sonoran Desert toad; Colorado River Toad. They sell them in the petstore near my house
    &amp; there are plenty of other places you
    can get them, but I am not going to tell you where. Why not?<br>
    <br>
    Because, if you are not smart enough to find'em yourself, you should not even attempt this. Besides; I tell you,
    you tell someone else, eventually the gestapo find out and everyone else is PHUCKED for
    possession of a controlled amphibian.<br>
