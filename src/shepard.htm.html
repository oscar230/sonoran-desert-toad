                Copyright: 1994 by The Associated Press, R<br>
                Date: Wed Feb 16 13:50:16 EST 1994<br>
                <br>
                ANGELS CAMP, Calif. (AP) -- The war on drugs has moved into Mark Twain's frog-jumping territory, and
                it's not pretty.<br>
                These drug suppliers are green, squat and lumpy, with big
                bulging eyes.
                That's not a description of some comic strip villain. These are
                toads -- Bufo alvarius.
                And forget that old myth that handling toads causes warts. These
                critters secrete a venom from glands on their backs.
                Drying the venom produces a hallucinogenic drug, bufotenine,
                that can be smoked, and users and researchers say it produces a
                high that eclipses the psychedelic properties of LSD. (Just imagine
                the effect that toad jokes would have had on the culture of the
                '60s.)
                And yes, it's illegal. ``Toke a toad, go to jail,'' suggest some
                wags.
                "What is the human race going to do next? Grind up clarinets
                and smoke them?" asked Calaveras County narcotics agent Greg Elam.
                After the arrest of a couple on charges of possessing bufotenine
                from four toads, state and local narcotics agents worried that
                there was a cult of toad abusers in the region.
                They've determined that's not the case.
                But literature confiscated from the couple's house indicates
                there is an underground of enthusiasts for the drug, agents said.<br>
                &quot;It's a bizarre case,'' said Matt Campoy, commander of the drug
                task force in Calaveras County 110 miles east of San Francisco.<br>
                Scientific journals trace use of the drug to ancient times. In
                the 1950s, the Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency supported
                research on bufotenine as part of efforts to develop brainwashing
                agents, according to the August 1990 Scientific American.
                Laws against its use in the United States date to the late
                1960s. But the task force was unable to find records that anyone
                else had actually been arrested for possessing it.
                Unrelated laws bar possession of the toads themselves, since their numbers are dwindling.
                Ironically, the arrests came in a region known not for toads but
                for frogs. A short story by Twain, ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of
                Calaveras County,'' inspired the Calaveras County Fair and Jumping
                Frog Jubilee, which marked its 65th year in 1993 and draws
                participants from throughout the nation.<br>
                Bob and Connie Shepard are scheduled for arraignment next month
                on charges of possessing the drug.
                Shepard, 41, a former teacher and Explorer Scout leader, and his
                37-year-old wife said they did not wish to talk to a reporter.
                But Shepard, also a former volunteer with the Calaveras County sheriff's search-and-rescue squad, told
                agents that he captured the
                four toads in southern Arizona.<br>
                Agents quoted him as saying he got so high from the drug he
                could "hear electrons jumping orbitals in his molecules."<br>
                Authorities moved in when they heard Sheppard had taken the
                toads to a school district learning center, where he was an instructor. Agents feared children might be
                affected.
                Some criticize authorities for pursuing the case.
                ``Here we've got murderers in the streets and we've got police
                going after people catching toads,'' said Dale Gieringer of the
                California Drug Policy Reform Coalition.
                ``This is victimless consensual crime. This is personal
                exploration of consciousness. It's something that should be a basic
                constitutional right.''<br>

                The drug carriers are green, squat, and lumpy, with big bulging eyes.

                One couple was arrested recently on charges of possessing bufotenine
                from four toads.
                Narcotics agents determined there was not a cult of bufotenine
                abusers in the region, but literature from the couple's house showed
                there was an underground of enthusiasts for the drug.<br>
                The couple told agents they obtained detailed directions on how to
                find and use the drug by writing for a pamphlet.
                "What is the human race going to do next? Grind up clarinets and smoke
                them?" asked Calaveras County narcotics agent Greg Elam, who headed

                Agents from a task force of state and local drug agents based at a
                Calaveras County shopping center received tips that led to the
                arrests.
                "It's a bizarre case," said Matt Campoy, commander of the task force.

                of the toad's cousin, the frog. A short story by Twain inspired the

                Bob Shepard, a 41-year-old former teacher and Explorer Scout
                leader told agents he captured the four toads in southern Arizona and

                1 Feb 94:<br>
                <br>
                (SONORA)- An Explorer Scout leader and his wife have been arraigned
                on drug possession charges after he admitted smoking hallucinogenic
                venom extracted from rare toads. Bob and Connie Shepard... teachers at a
                public school-sponsored nature camp... each face up to 15 years in
                prison if convicted of possessing bufotenine, a hallucinogenic chemical
                believed to be the psychoactive agent in toad venom, and other
                controlled substances.&nbsp;
                <br>
                Tuolemne County prosecutor Jim Boscoe said venom is produced by
                glands behind each eye of the Colorado River toad, and is said to
                produce an intense psychedelic high. Users squeeze the venom from the
                glands and dry it before smoking it. The seized toads are currently
                living in the offices of the combined drug task force of Alpine,
                Calaveras and Tuolomne counties, across the street from the Calaveras
                County Fair made famous by a Mark Twain story about a frog jumping
                competition.
